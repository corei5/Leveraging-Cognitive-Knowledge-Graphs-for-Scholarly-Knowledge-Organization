            Therapeutic development is critical for preventing and treating continual MERS-CoV infections in humans and camels. Because of their small size, nanobodies (Nbs) have advantages as antiviral therapeutics (e.g., high expression yield and robustness for storage and transportation) and also potential limitations (e.g., low antigen-binding affinity and fast renal clearance). Here, we have developed novel Nbs that specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein. They bind to a conserved site on MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, blocking RBD's binding to MERS-CoV receptor. Through engineering a C-terminal human Fc tag, the

            half-life of the Nbs is significantly extended. Moreover, the Nbs can potently cross-neutralize the infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. The Fc-tagged Nb also completely protects humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Taken together, our study has discovered novel Nbs that hold promise as potent, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.

We first examined the basin‐scale community structure of diazotrophs and their nitrogen fixation activity within the euphotic zone during the northeast monsoon period along about 69°E from 17°N to 20°S in the oligotrophic Indian Ocean, where a shallow nitracline (49–59 m) prevailed widely and the sea surface temperature (SST) was above 25°C. Phosphate was detectable at the surface throughout the study area. The dissolved iron concentration and the ratio of iron to nitrate + nitrite at the surface were significantly higher in the Arabian Sea than in the equatorial and southern Indian Ocean. Nitrogen fixation in the Arabian Sea (24.6–47.1 μmolN m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was also significantly greater than that in the equatorial and southern Indian Ocean (6.27–16.6 μmolN m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), indicating that iron could control diazotrophy in the Indian Ocean. Phylogenetic analysis of <jats:italic>nifH</jats:italic> showed that most diazotrophs belonged to the Proteobacteria and that cyanobacterial diazotrophs were absent in the study area except in the Arabian Sea. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation was not associated with light intensity throughout the study area. These results are consistent with nitrogen fixation in the Indian Ocean, being largely performed by heterotrophic bacteria and not by cyanobacteria. The low cyanobacterial diazotrophy was attributed to the shallow nitracline, which is rarely observed in the Pacific and Atlantic oligotrophic oceans. Because the shallower nitracline favored enhanced upward nitrate flux, the competitive advantage of cyanobacterial diazotrophs over nondiazotrophic phytoplankton was not as significant as it is in other oligotrophic oceans."

This unit is overlain by more basaltic material, which has 1 µm and 2 µm absorptions due to pyroxene that are typical of Martian basaltic materials. Both materials are partially obscured by aeolian dust and basaltic sand.

This compositional difference may be related to aeolian grain sorting."

Projections of mean global sea‐level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea‐level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a <jats:italic>very likely</jats:italic> (90% probability) GSL rise of 0.5–1.2 m under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4–0.9 m under RCP 4.5, and 0.3–0.8 m under RCP 2.6. Site‐to‐site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non‐climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1‐in‐10” and “1‐in‐100” year events.</jats:sec>"

These in situ lunar spectra have revealed less mature features than that measured remotely by spaceborne sensors such as the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on board the Chandrayaan‐1 mission and the Spectral Profiler on board the Kaguya over the same region. Mineral composition analysis using a spectral lookup table populated with a radiative transfer mixing model has shown that the regolith at the landing site contains high abundance of olivine. The mineral abundance results are consistent with that inferred from the compound measurement made by the on board alpha‐particle X‐ray spectrometer.

The reworked zone has two to five distinct layers and consists of surface regolith. The paleoregolith buried by the ejecta from a 500 m crater is relatively homogenous and contains only a few rocks. Population of buried rocks increases with depth to ~2 m at first, and then decreases with depth, representing a balance between initial deposition of the ejecta and later turnover of the regolith. Combining with the surface age, the LPR observations indicate a mean accumulation rate of about 5–10 m/Gyr for the surface regolith, which is at least 4–8 times larger than previous estimation."

The SMCM configuration we use here has been tuned to represent observed tropical convection by associating the occurrence and strength of deep convection to midtropospheric vertical velocity and relative humidity. We show that compared to the ECHAM6.3 standard model, the SMCM‐modified version shows improved capacity to simulate features of tropical intraseasonal variability, including MJO‐like disturbances, without significantly distorting the mean model climate. This improvement goes in hand with ameliorated coupling of atmospheric convection to tropospheric moisture and spatiotemporal coherence of tropical convection compared to reanalysis and observations. We attribute these effects to (i) improved coupling of triggering and suppression of deep convective events to the model's large‐scale environment and (ii) the observations‐informed closure formulation which leads to an overall reduction of deep convective mass fluxes. Sensitivity tests show that while (ii) improves the convection‐moisture relationship, it is (i) which improves the spatiotemporal coherence of tropical rainfall and is important for MJO simulation. Further, the simulated spatiotemporal coherence of tropical rainfall is an intrinsic property of the convection schemes themselves and not of their parameters. We stress that this study serves as a proof‐of‐concept and motivates further efforts towards building a novel convection parameterization with the SMCM as a central element."

Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea‐level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice‐sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global‐mean sea‐level (GMSL) and relative sea‐level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93–243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26–98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches &gt;10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea‐level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post‐2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks."

The Paris Climate Agreement's proposed temperature thresholds of 1.5°C and 2°C have directed the research community to ask what differences occur in the climate system for these two states. We have developed a novel approach to combine climate model outputs that follow specific temperature pathways to make probabilistic projections of sea‐level in a 1.5°C and 2°C world. We find median global sea‐level (GSL) projections for 1.5°C and 2°C temperature pathways of 44 and 50 cm, respectively. The 90% uncertainty ranges (5%–95%) are both around 48 cm by 2100. In addition, we take an alternative approach to estimate the contribution from ice sheets by using a semi‐empirical GSL model. Here we find median projections of 58 and 68 cm for 1.5°C and 2°C temperature pathways. The 90% uncertainty ranges are 67 and 82 cm respectively. Regional projections show similar patterns for both temperature pathways, though differences vary between the median projections (2–10 cm) and 95th percentile (5–20 cm) for the bulk of oceans using process‐based approach and 10–15 cm (median) and 15–25 cm (95th percentile) using the semi‐empirical approach.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Plain Language Summary</jats:title>The sea level you experience at the coast can be estimated by the sum of contributions from ocean expansion, currents, ice melt from glaciers and ice sheets, land‐water extraction/damming, and land motion.

We estimate how much sea‐level could change if societies achieve either of the Paris Climate Agreement's temperature targets by 2100. If we reach 1.5°C or 2.0°C by 2100, GSL should rise around 44–50 cm, respectively. Using a slightly different method we find the global rise could be 58–68 cm. An incomplete picture of the sea‐level components means that estimates could be out by up to 80 cm, though all projections show a sea‐level rise of at least 20 cm.</jats:sec>"

However, policy makers do not currently know exactly what carbon emissions pathways to follow to stabilize warming below these agreed targets, because there is large uncertainty in future temperature rise for any given pathway. This large uncertainty makes it difficult for a cautious policy maker to avoid either: (1) allowing warming to exceed the agreed target or (2) cutting global emissions more than is required to satisfy the agreed target, and their associated societal costs. This study presents a novel Adjusting Mitigation Pathway (AMP) approach to restrict future warming to policy‐driven targets, in which future emissions reductions are not fully determined now but respond to future surface warming each decade in a self‐adjusting manner. A large ensemble of Earth system model simulations, constrained by geological and historical observations of past climate change, demonstrates our self‐adjusting mitigation approach for a range of climate stabilization targets ranging from 1.5°C to 4.5°C, and generates AMP scenarios up to year 2300 for surface warming, carbon emissions, atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, global mean sea level, and surface ocean acidification.

Based on rheological and polarized optical microscopy investigations, a rational relation between GO sheet size and polydispersity, concentration, liquid crystallinity, and spinnability is proposed, leading to an understanding of lyotropic LC behavior and fiber spinnability. The knowledge gained from the straightforward formulation of LC GO “inks” in a range of processable concentrations enables the spinning of continuous conducting, strong, and robust fibers at concentrations as low as 0.075 wt%, eliminating the need for relatively concentrated spinning dope dispersions. The dilute LC GO dispersion is proven to be suitable for fiber spinning using a number of coagulation strategies, including non‐solvent precipitation, dispersion destabilization, ionic cross‐linking, and polyelectrolyte complexation. One‐step continuous spinning of graphene fibers and yarns is introduced for the first time by in situ spinning of LC GO in basic coagulation baths (i.e., NaOH or KOH), eliminating the need for post‐treatment processes.

Here, a new design strategy is proposed and demonstrated to improve both fatigue resistance and self‐healing property of DN gels by introducing a ductile, nonsoft gel with strong hydrophobic interactions as the second network. Based on this design strategy, a new type of fully physically cross‐linked Agar/hydrophobically associated polyacrylamide (HPAAm) DN gels are synthesized by a simple one‐pot method. Agar/HPAAm DN gels exhibit excellent mechanical strength and high toughness, comparable to the reported DN gels. More importantly, because the ductile and tough second network of HPAAm can bear stress and reconstruct network structure, Agar/HPAAm DN gels also demonstrate rapid self‐recovery, remarkable fatigue resistance, and notable self‐healing property without any external stimuli at room temperature. In contrast to the former DN gels in both network structures and underlying association forces, this new design strategy to prepare highly mechanical DN gels provides a new avenue to better understand the fundamental structure‐property relationship of DN hydrogels, thus broadening current hydrogel research and applications."

Here, a highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensor is fabricated based on the composite of fragmentized graphene foam (FGF) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A graphene foam (GF) is disintegrated into 200–300 μm sized fragments while maintaining its 3D structure by using a vortex mixer, forming a percolation network of the FGFs. The strain sensor shows high sensitivity with a gauge factor of 15 to 29, which is much higher compared to the GF/PDMS strain sensor with a gauge factor of 2.2. It is attributed to the great change in the contact resistance between FGFs over the large contact area, when stretched. In addition to the high sensitivity, the FGF/PDMS strain sensor exhibits high stretchability over 70% and high durability over 10 000 stretching‐releasing cycles. When the sensor is attached to the human body, it functions as a health‐monitoring device by detecting various human motions such as the bending of elbows and fingers in addition to the pulse of radial artery. Finally, by using the FGF, PDMS, and μ‐LEDs, a stretchable touch sensor array is fabricated, thus demonstrating its potential application as an artificial skin."

The method includes drying a diluted physical hydrogel in air by confining its length direction. During this process, sufficiently high tensile stress is built along the length direction to align the polymer chains and multiscale fibrous structures (from nano‐ to submicro‐ to microscale) are spontaneously formed in the bulk material, which are well‐retained in the reswollen gel. The method is useful for relatively rigid polymers (such as alginate and cellulose), which are susceptible to mechanical signal. By controlling the drying with or without prestretching, the degree of alignment, size of superstructures, and the strength of supramolecular interactions can be tuned, which sensitively influence the strength and toughness of the hydrogels. The mechanical properties are comparable with those of natural ligaments.

The physical aging process of PET occurring at 70 °C is shown to gradually convert MAF to polymer microstructures with limited accessibility to enzymatic hydrolysis. Analysis of the chain‐length distribution of degraded PET by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that MAF is rapidly hydrolyzed via a combinatorial exo‐ and endo‐type degradation mechanism whereas the remaining PET microstructures are slowly degraded only by endo‐type chain scission causing no detectable weight loss. Hence, efficient thermostable biocatalysts are required to overcome the competitive physical aging process for the complete degradation of postconsumer PET materials close to the glass transition temperature of PET."

Despite the publication of its baseline vision over 30 years ago and the resulting diversity of interpretations and subdisciplines in engineering and social sciences, the progress of the approach in industrial practice remains marginal. This is mainly due to the fact that the discipline has not yet succeeded to realize the magnitude of the rethinking necessary of its very own perception as a whole. Existing definitions of sustainable production presented to date are thus only partly consistently derived from the baseline concept. Meanwhile, digitalization provides an increasing number of technologies that offer a new perspective on sustainable production. This especially applies to the concept of digital twins. Recent studies, thus, address their role in the context of sustainable production by analyzing its contribution to existing sustainability related methods as well as technical challenges on a microeconomic level (bottom‐up approach). Although these approaches provide concrete requirements for technical deployment, it is highly questionable how they will contribute to sustainable production as a whole. In this paper, we choose a top‐down approach to discuss the role of digital twins in the context of sustainable production. Based on fundamental reflections on the baseline concept of sustainability, we advocate a reorientation of production within the framework of planetary boundaries. Thereupon, we discuss the role of digital twins and digital threads and provide a number of requirements that future R&amp;D needs to address for a future sustainability‐oriented data‐driven monitoring and regulation of production."

Just as with data, the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient science. In this article, we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify software “mentions” and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31% and 43% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible (15%–29% of packages in any form; between 90% and 98% of specific versions; only between 24%–40% provide source code). Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts. Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication."

Here we identify the 250 most heavily used journals in each of 26 research fields (4,721 journals, 19.4M articles) indexed by the Scopus database, and test whether topic, academic status, and accessibility make articles from these journals more or less likely to be referenced on Wikipedia. We find that a journal's academic status (impact factor) and accessibility (open access policy) both strongly increase the probability of it being referenced on Wikipedia. Controlling for field and impact factor, the odds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher compared to paywall journals.

We open the “black box” of data archives by studying DANS, the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands, which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences, humanities, and other domains. Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit data sets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential.

With the aim of a more fundamental insight we investigate plasmas in a) functionalization of implants with antimicrobial as well as cell attachment enhancing surfaces b) atmospheric pressure plasmas (APPs) in inactivation of bacteria, decontamination of bottles and food products, as well as medical equipment and c) APPs in medical therapy and their effects on cell viability as a means to finding a plasma “dosage”. The possibilities of an application focused designing of plasma sources will be emphasized. On the example of feed gas humidity and its significant influence the importance of determining and controlling unobvious or hidden parameter is demonstrated (© 2012 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Here, we show that variation in establishment success of nonnative frogs and toads is primarily explained by variation in introduction pathways and climatic similarity between the native range and introduction locality, with minor contributions from phylogeny, species ecology, and life history. This finding contrasts with recent evidence that particular species characteristics promote evolutionary range expansion and reduce the probability of extinction in native populations of amphibians, emphasizing how different mechanisms may shape species distributions on different temporal and spatial scales. We suggest that contemporary changes in the distribution of amphibians will be primarily determined by human‐mediated extinctions and movement of species within climatic envelopes, and less by species‐typical traits."

However, the expression of apomixis is typically linked to polyploidy. Thus, it is a priori not clear whether intrinsic effects related to the change in the reproductive mode or rather in the ploidy drive ecological differentiation. We used sympatric sexual and apomictic populations of <jats:italic>Potentilla puberula</jats:italic> to test for ecological differentiation. To distinguish the effects of reproductive mode and ploidy on the ecology of cytotypes, we compared the niches (a) of sexuals (tetraploids) and autopolyploid apomicts (penta‐, hepta‐, and octoploids) and (b) of the three apomictic cytotypes. We based comparisons on a ploidy screen of 238 populations along a latitudinal transect through the Eastern European Alps and associated bioclimatic, and soil and topographic data. Sexual tetraploids preferred primary habitats at drier, steeper, more south‐oriented slopes, while apomicts mostly occurred in human‐made habitats with higher water availability. Contrariwise, we found no or only marginal ecological differentiation among the apomictic higher ploids. Based on the pronounced ecological differences found between sexuals and apomicts, in addition to the lack of niche differentiation among cytotypes of the same reproductive mode, we conclude that reproductive mode rather than ploidy is the main driver of the observed differences. Moreover, we compared our system with others from the literature, to stress the importance of identifying alternative confounding effects (such as hybrid origin). Finally, we underline the relevance of studying ecological parthenogenesis in sympatry, to minimize the effects of differential migration abilities."

This requires a sensitivity analysis of a response function (defined on the target region) with respect to the source(s) of pollutant(s). The basic and straightforward approach to sensitivity analysis consists of multiple simulations of the pollution transport model with variations of the parameters that define the source of the pollutant. A more systematic approach uses the adjoint of the pollution transport model derived from applying the principle of variations. Both approaches assume that the transport velocity and the initial distribution of the pollutant are known. However, when observations of both the velocity and concentration fields are available, the transport velocity and the initial distribution of the pollutant are given by the solution of a data assimilation problem. As a consequence, the sensitivity analysis should be carried out on the optimality system of the data assimilation problem, and not on the direct model alone. This leads to a sensitivity analysis that involves the second‐order adjoint model, which is presented in the present work. It is especially shown theoretically and with numerical experiments that the sensitivity on the optimality system includes important terms that are ignored by the sensitivity on the direct model. The latter shows only the direct effects of the variation of the source on the response function while the first shows the indirect effects in addition to the direct effects.

New oligodendrocytes arise through the differentiation of platelet‐derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) expressing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that are widely distributed throughout the CNS. Although there has been detailed investigation of the behavior of these progenitors in white matter, recent studies suggest that disease burden in multiple sclerosis (MS) is more strongly correlated with gray matter atrophy. The timing and efficiency of remyelination in gray matter is distinct from white matter, but the dynamics of OPCs that contribute to these differences have not been defined. Here, we used <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> genetic fate tracing to determine the behavior of OPCs in gray and white matter regions in response to cuprizone‐induced demyelination. Our studies indicate that the temporal dynamics of OPC differentiation varies significantly between white and gray matter. While OPCs rapidly repopulate the corpus callosum and mature into CC1 expressing mature oligodendrocytes, OPC differentiation in the cingulate cortex and hippocampus occurs much more slowly, resulting in a delay in remyelination relative to the corpus callosum. The protracted maturation of OPCs in gray matter may contribute to greater axonal pathology and disease burden in MS."

These stimuli consist of two spatially coincident dynamic gratings of differing orientations, which are either perceived to move in two unique directions or are integrated by the visual system to elicit the percept of a checkerboard moving in a single direction. Computations pertaining to the motion of the individual component gratings are thought to take place in striate cortex (V1) whereas motion integration is thought to involve neurons in dorsal stream extrastriate visual areas, particularly V5/MT. By combining a psychophysical task that employed plaid stimuli with 1 Hz offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we demonstrated a double dissociation between striate and extrastriate visual cortex in terms of their contributions to motion integration. rTMS over striate cortex increased coherent motion percepts whereas rTMS over extrastriate cortex had the opposite effect. These effects were robust directly after the stimulation administration and gradually returned to baseline within 15 minutes. This double dissociation is consistent with previous patient data and the recent hypothesis that both coherent and transparent motion percepts are supported by the visual system simultaneously and compete for perceptual dominance.

In a within‐subjects (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 17) repeated measurement design including real TBS and a control session without stimulation, we examined neural activation in a choice‐reaction task after application of intermittent TBS, a protocol, which enhances cortical excitability over the left motor cortex (M1). Brain activity was monitored by blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging interleaved with measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest using MR‐based perfusion imaging. On a separate day, TMS‐induced compound muscle action potentials (cMAPs) amplitude of the right hand was measured after excitatory TBS. Compared to control, a significant decrease in BOLD signal due to right hand motor activity during the choice‐reaction task was observed mainly in the stimulated M1 and motor‐related remote areas after stimulation. This decrease might represent a facilitating effect, because cMAPs amplitude increased upon TBS compared to control. No changes in rCBF at rest were observed. The data demonstrate that subthreshold intermittent TBS targets both the stimulated cortical area as well as remote areas.

In this combined rTMS/EEG study, we aimed to investigate changes in oscillatory activity after high‐frequency (∼11 Hz) rTMS relative to the number of applied pulses. Twenty intermittent trains of 20 or 60 rTMS pulses were delivered over the human primary motor cortex at rest and tuned to individual mu frequency. The regional and interregional oscillatory neural activity after stimulation were evaluated using event‐related power (ERPow) and event‐related coherence (ERCoh) transformations. The most prominent changes for ERPow were observed in the theta band (4–7 Hz), as an increase in ERPow up to 20 s following 60 rTMS pulses, whereas ERPow increases were smaller in mu (10–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz). ERCoh revealed that rTMS 60 modulated the connectivity in the theta band for up to 20 s. The topography of mu and theta changes were not identical; mu was more focal and theta was more global. Our data suggested the presence of independent cortical theta and mu generators with different reactivity to rTMS but could not rule out possible thalamocortical contributions in generating theta and mu over the motor network.

However, treatment response is limited and there are no good demographic or clinical predictors for treatment outcome. We used state‐of‐the‐art voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) to investigate whether transcranial magnetic stimulation‐induced neuroplasticity determines therapeutic outcome. Sixty subjects chronically experiencing phantom sounds (i.e., tinnitus) received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of left dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortex according to a protocol that has been shown to yield a significantly higher number of treatment responders than sham stimulation and previous stimulation protocols. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after rTMS. In VBM whole‐brain analyses (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected), we assessed longitudinal gray matter changes as well as structural connectivity between the ensuing regions. We observed longitudinal mesoscopic gray matter changes of left dorsolateral prefontal (DLPFC), left operculo‐insular, and right inferior temporal cortex (ITC) in responders (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 22) but not nonresponders (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 38), as indicated by a group × time interaction and post‐hoc tests. These results were neither influenced by age, sex, hearing loss nor by tinnitus laterality, duration, and severity at baseline. Furthermore, we found robust DLPFC–insula and insula–ITC connectivity in responders, while only relatively weak DLPFC–insula connectivity and no insula–ITC connectivity could be demonstrated in nonresponders. Our results reinforce the implication of nonauditory brain regions in phantom sounds and suggest the dependence of therapeutic response on their neuroplastic capabilities. The latter in turn may depend on (differences in) their individual structural connectivity. <jats:italic>Hum Brain Mapp 39:554–562, 2018</jats:italic>. © <jats:bold>2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:bold>"

However, some machine learning models have been criticized for requiring a large number of cases in each experimental group, and for resembling a “black box” that provides little or no insight into the nature of the data. In this article, we propose an alternative conceptual and practical approach for investigating brain‐based disorders which aim to overcome these limitations. We used an artificial neural network known as “deep autoencoder” to create a normative model using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,113 healthy people. We then used this model to estimate total and regional neuroanatomical deviation in individual patients with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder using two independent data sets (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 263). We report that the model was able to generate different values of total neuroanatomical deviation for each disease under investigation relative to their control group (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; .005). Furthermore, the model revealed distinct patterns of neuroanatomical deviations for the two diseases, consistent with the existing neuroimaging literature. We conclude that the deep autoencoder provides a flexible and promising framework for assessing total and regional neuroanatomical deviations in neuropsychiatric populations."

The complementary information of both modalities in EMEG can be exploited on the basis of detailed and individualized head models."

Job autonomy and partner support mitigated some of these effects. In sum, women's psychological health was more strongly affected by the pandemic than men's. We discuss implications for occupational health theories and that interventions targeted at mitigating the psychological consequences of the COVID‐19 pandemic should target women specifically."

Physical characterization of the bilayer wound dressing showed that it has excellent oxygen permeability, that it controls the water vapor transmission rate, and that it promotes water uptake capability. AgSD dissolved from bilayer chitosan dressings to release silver and sulfadiazine. The release of sulfadiazine from the bilayer chitosan dressing displayed a burst release on the first day and then tapered off to a much slower release.

However, PVA's hydrophilicity hinders its capacity to act as a substrate for cell attachment. As a remedy, PVA was blended with chitosan, gelatin, or starch, and hydrogels were formed by subjecting the solutions to freeze‐thaw cycles followed by coagulation bath immersion. The structure‐property relationships for these hydrogels were examined by measurement of their swelling, rehydration, degradation, and mechanical properties. For the case of pure PVA hydrogels, the equilibrium swelling ratio was used to predict the effect of freeze thaw cycles and coagulation bath on average molecular weights between crosslinks and on mesh size. For all hydrogels, trends for the reswelling ratio, which is indicative of the crosslinked polymer fraction, were consistent with relative tensile properties. The coagulation bath treatment increased the degradation resistance of the hydrogels significantly. The suitability of each hydrogel for cell attachment and proliferation was examined by protein adsorption and bovine vascular endothelial cell culture experiments. Protein adsorption and cell proliferation was highest on the PVA/gelatin hydrogels. This study demonstrates that the potential of PVA hydrogels for artificial blood vessel applications can be improved by the addition of natural polymers, and that freeze‐thawing and coagulation bath treatment can be utilized for fine adjustment of the physical characteristics. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID‐19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and clinical features of COVID‐19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the unique features of COVID‐19 and enhance our control measures in the future."

COVID‐19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined CT values of COVID‐positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D‐dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4–8 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4–8 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4–8 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C‐reactive protein, and D‐dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = .027).

NWA 4884 is composed of mostly clinopyroxene (25.8 vol.%), pigeonite (16.6 vol.%), plagioclase (26.6 vol.%), maskelynite (8.1 vol.%), olivine (20.7 vol.%), minor tridymite (1.0 vol.%), quartz (0.2 vol.%), and ilmenite (0.5 vol.%). Lithic clasts contain mafic rocks including plutonic ultramafic cumulate, olivine gabbro, mare basalt, and feldspathic rocks including noritic anorthosite and impact melt breccia. Raman and FTIR spectroscopic analyses are combined to investigate the shock history of this breccia and revealed that NWA 4884 is highly shocked (17.9–48.1 GPa recorded in plagioclase). The combination of bulk composition and remote sensing data provides possible source regions of NWA 4884: the southern Lacus Veris (20.5°S, 84.5°W) within Orientale basin and the western mare unit (45.3°N, 151.3°E) of Campbell Crater. The pairing relationship among NWA 4884, Yamato 793274, Queen Alexandra Range 94281, and NWA 7611 is supported by their petrographic, mineral, and compositional similarities.

However, how to improve the accuracy of spatial prediction is not well addressed in the karst region of southwestern China. This study evaluates the performance of univariate kriging (ordinary kriging (OK)) and hybrid kriging (co‐kriging (CK), regression kriging (RK) and residual maximum likelihood (REML)) in mapping the spatial distribution of SOC at a depth of 0–15 cm. Terrain attributes and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used as ancillary variables.<jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> The distribution of SOC was significantly related to NDVI and terrain attributes. Furthermore, geostatistical analyses reflected a moderately structured spatial correlation of SOC. Regression analyses identified the NDVI and slope as the best predictors for describing the spatial pattern of SOC. Combined with NDVI and slope gradient, REML and RK performed better in increasing map prediction accuracy and decreasing the soothing effect of kriging.<jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The spatial pattern of SOC was controlled by topography and cultivation activity. The predictive abilities of OK and CK were limited. Combined with the auxiliary variables, REML and RK can improve the prediction accuracy.

Prior work suggests an intermediate pulse frequency, 5 Hz, is also efficacious for treating comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms. In this chart review study, we systematically examined the clinical and safety outcomes in 10 patients with comorbid MDD and PTSD syndromes who received 5‐Hz rTMS therapy at the Providence VA Medical Center Neuromodulation Clinic. Self‐report scales measured illness severity prior to treatment, after every 5 treatments, and upon completion of treatment.

However, PLA has shown to not be degradable in some environmentally relevant conditions, including within the freshwater systems. Additionally, PLA suffers from very poor barrier properties, which could result in food spoilage. Compositing with clay has been used to improve barrier properties according to tortuous path theory. Here a synthetic, large aspect ratio Na‐Hectorite is used that may be utterly delaminated in an organic solvent and composited with PLA by modification with 18‐crown‐6 (18C6Hec), yielding a castable, homogeneous nematic suspension. Upon drying, thermodynamics drive the suspension toward segregation into sublayers of PLA and partially restacked 18C6Hec in situ. This unique self‐assembled nanostructure combines the best of two worlds: The aspect ratio remains high and results in a 99.3% reduction in oxygen permeability. Additionally, the film shows surprisingly high resistance to swelling at elevated humidity, but once soaked in water, clay swelling is triggered, which fragments the film and drastically increases the surface area by 2500%.

Most tough hydrogels are designed through incorporating large energy dissipation from breaking sacrificial bonds. However, these hydrogels still fracture under prolonged cyclic loads with the presence of even small flaws. This paper presents a principle of flaw‐insensitive hydrogels under both static and cyclic loads. The design aligns the polymer chains in a hydrogel at the molecular level to deflect a crack. To demonstrate this principle, a hydrogel of polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol is prepared with aligned crystalline domains. When the hydrogel is stretched in the direction of alignment, an initial flaw deflects, propagates along the loading direction, peels off the material, and leaves the hydrogel flawless again. The hydrogel is insensitive to pre‐existing flaws, even under more than ten thousand loading cycles. The critical degree of anisotropy to achieve crack deflection is quantified by experiments and fracture mechanics. The principle can be generalized to other hydrogel systems."

In this paper, we put forth a data‐driven framework to address these challenges leveraging recent advances in machine learning. We combine multifidelity Gaussian process regression and Bayesian optimization to construct probabilistic surrogate models for given quantities of interest and explore high‐dimensional design spaces in a cost‐effective manner. The synergistic use of these computational tools gives rise to a tractable and general framework for tackling realistic multidisciplinary optimization problems. To demonstrate the specific merits of our approach, we have chosen a challenging large‐scale application involving the hydrostructural optimization of three‐dimensional supercavitating hydrofoils. To this end, we have developed an automated workflow for performing multiresolution simulations of turbulent multiphase flows and multifidelity structural mechanics (combining three‐dimensional and one‐dimensional finite element results), the results of which drive our machine learning analysis in pursuit of the optimal hydrofoil shape."

The subspace can be described in a very general way and to obtain it no Trefftz functions have to be calculated explicitly, instead the corresponding embedding operator is constructed. In the simplest cases the method recovers established Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods. But the approach allows to conveniently extend to general cases, including inhomogeneous sources and non‐constant coefficient differential operators. We introduce the method, discuss implementational aspects and explore its potential on a set of standard PDE problems.

The experimental results show that both treatments lead to similar resist bulk chemical modifications that result in a decrease of the resist glass transition temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>). This drop in <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub> allows polymer chain rearrangement that favors surface roughness smoothening. The smoothening effect is mainly attributed to main chain scission induced by plasma VUV light. For increased VUV light exposure time, the crosslinking mechanism dominates over main chain scission and limits surface roughness smoothening. In the case of the HBr plasma treatment, the synergy between Bromine radicals and VUV light leads to the formation of dense graphitized layers on top and sidewalls surfaces of the resist pattern. The presence of a dense layer on the HBr cured resist sidewalls prevents from resist pattern reflowing but on the counter side leads to increased surface roughness and linewidth roughness compared to VUV light treatment.<jats:boxed-text content-type=""graphic"" position=""anchor""><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" mimetype=""image/jpeg"" position=""anchor"" specific-use=""enlarged-web-image"" xlink:href=""graphic/mgra001.jpg""><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>

The fish fauna presents 11 native freshwater species, including eight with high conservation status. Several exotic species are present, the most important being the American centrarchids pumpkinseed fish and largemouth bass. As a typical mediterranean‐type river, the Guadiana has an irregular hydrological regime with severe drought periods and floods; the interannual variation of discharge presents a ratio of <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 100 to 1.From 1980 to 1995 several dry years were observed, culminating in the drought of 19910/92–19947/95. Analysing the variation of the fish assemblage structure during this period, exotic species (mostly pumpkinseed) progressively increased, strongly dominating in 1995. Indigenous populations dramatically decreased and a previously common endemic cyprinid (<jats:italic>Anaecypris hispanica</jats:italic> Steindachner) became endangered and one of the most threatened fishes of Europe. However, the following years presented above‐average flows with several flood events and an inverse process occurred, with native species increasing their contribution in a short period.The importance of floods as a disturbance factor in the control of lentic or slow flowing water exotics is discussed. Native species apparently possess adaptive responses to high flows which exotics lack. This hypothesis is consistent with probability‐of‐use curves and preflood–postflood surveys. Results emphasize the importance of floods in the environmental flows of mediterranean‐type rivers. In the absence of flooding disturbance, exotic fish populations predictably grow, increasing the pressure on native species; abiotic disturbance may supersede deterministic outcomes of predation or competition and influence community structure by reducing populations of the exotic species.

Following a 12‐year recovery period, the distribution, composition and cover of both exotic and native plant species were studied along a Portuguese lowland river segment, which had been subjected to resectioning, straightening and two‐stage bank reinforcement, and were compared with those of a nearby, less impacted segment. The species distribution was also related to environmental data. Species richness and floristic composition in the channelized river segment were found to be similar to those at the more ‘natural’ river sites. Floral differences were primarily consistent with the dominance of cover by certain species.

After describing how the occupations associated with each web vacancy (classification up to level 4) were identified and the related skills retrieved in texts using mixed supervised and unsupervised text mining approaches, we focused on job vacancies related to ICT and statistical positions.The principal aim of this paper is to describe these jobs in terms of the required skills that have emerged in the labour market from a demand perspective and to identify those skills that best distinguish statisticians from other ICT occupations. Hence, several machine learning techniques were used to assess those skills that best distinguish occupation codes from other job groups.After quality control and removal of duplications, the scraping collected more than 110,000 job advertisements: nearly 6,200 were classified as ICT or statistical positions (largely dominated by software developers). The data indicate that high‐level statisticians have superior and heterogeneous professional backgrounds, linked to theoretical statistics, where analytic skills are more relevant than computing skills.

WSNs are prone to various hole attacks, such as sinkhole, wormhole, blackhole, and greyhole. Among these hole attacks, the sinkhole attack is the malignant one. A sinkhole attack allows a malicious node, called the sinkhole node, advertises a best possible path to the base station (BS). This misguides its neighbors to utilize that path more frequently. The sinkhole node has the opportunity to tamper with the data, and it also performs the modifications in messages or it drops messages or it produces unnecessary delay before forwarding them to the BS. On the basis of these malicious acts that are performed by a sinkhole attacker node, we consider three types of malicious nodes in a WSN: sinkhole message modification node (SMD), sinkhole message dropping node (SDP), and sinkhole message delay node (SDL). None of the existing techniques in the literature is capable to handle all three types of nodes at a time. This paper presents a new detection scheme for the detection of different types of sinkhole nodes for a hierarchical wireless sensor network (HWSN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design such a detection scheme in HWSNs which can detect SMD, SDP, and SDL nodes. In our approach, the entire HWSN is divided into several disjoint clusters, and each cluster has a powerful high‐end sensor node (called a cluster head), which is responsible for the detection of different sinkhole attacker nodes if present in that cluster. We simulate our scheme using the widely‐accepted NS2 simulator for measurement of various network parameters. The proposed scheme achieves around 95<jats:italic>%</jats:italic> detection rate and 1.25<jats:italic>%</jats:italic> false positive rate. These factors are significantly better than the previous related schemes. Furthermore, the computation and communication efficiency is achieved in our scheme.

Although many successful strategies have been proposed to improve hydrogels' mechanical strength during the past decades, a hydrogel with a tensile stress surpassing dozens of mega Pascal is desirable, yet still a big challenge. To address this issue, the Fe<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup>‐mediated physical crosslinking formed under stretch conditions was employed in a chemically crosslinked poly (acrylamide‐co‐acrylic acid) network to achieve a dual‐crosslinked hydrogel.

By optimizing the experimental parameters, the nominal tensile stress along pre‐stretching direction can reach as high as ≈40 MPa with elastic modulus of ≈40 MPa at large strain (&gt;200%). In addition, the molecular orientation also leads to big difference of mechanical performance between parallel and perpendicular direction."

However, such information is often fragmented, with multiple perspectives from multiple parties involved during on‐going interactions. In this paper, the authors propose a Crowd‐based Requirements Engineering approach by Argumentation (CrowdRE‐Arg). The framework is based on the analysis of the textual conversations found in user forums, identification of features, issues and the arguments that are in favour or opposing a given requirements statement. The analysis is to generate an argumentation model of the involved user statements, retrieve the conflicting‐viewpoints, reason about the winning‐arguments and present that to systems analysts to make informed‐requirements decisions. For this purpose, the authors adopted a bipolar argumentation framework and a coalition‐based meta‐argumentation framework as well as user voting techniques. The CrowdRE‐Arg approach and its algorithms are illustrated through two sample conversations threads taken from the Reddit forum. Additionally, the authors devised algorithms that can identify conflict‐free features or issues based on their supporting and attacking arguments. The authors tested these machine learning algorithms on a set of 3,051 user comments, preprocessed using the content analysis technique. The results show that the proposed algorithms correctly and efficiently identify conflict‐free features and issues along with their winning arguments."

Traditionally, the main goal has been to maximize coverage. However, other objectives can be defined, such as the oracle cost, which is the cost of executing the entire test suite and the cost of checking the system behavior. Indeed, in very large software systems, the cost spent to test the system can be an issue, and then it makes sense by considering two conflicting objectives: maximizing the coverage and minimizing the oracle cost. This is what we did in this paper. We mainly compared two approaches to deal with the multi‐objective test data generation problem: a direct multi‐objective approach and a combination of a mono‐objective algorithm together with multi‐objective test case selection optimization. Concretely, in this work, we used four state‐of‐the‐art multi‐objective algorithms and two mono‐objective evolutionary algorithms followed by a multi‐objective test case selection based on Pareto efficiency. The experimental analysis compares these techniques on two different benchmarks. The first one is composed of 800 Java programs created through a program generator. The second benchmark is composed of 13 real programs extracted from the literature. In the direct multi‐objective approach, the results indicate that the oracle cost can be properly optimized; however, the full branch coverage of the system poses a great challenge. Regarding the mono‐objective algorithms, although they need a second phase of test case selection for reducing the oracle cost, they are very effective in maximizing the branch coverage.

Humans represent information about the external world and internal mental states, like beliefs and desires, and use this information to meet goals (e.g., classification or problem solving). Unfortunately, researchers do not have direct access to mental representations. Instead, cognitive scientists design experiments and implement computational models to develop theories about the mental representations present during task performance. There are several main types of mental representation and corresponding processes that have been posited: spatial, feature, network, and structured. Each type has a particular structure and a set of processes that are capable of accessing and manipulating information within the representation. The structure and processes determine what information can be used during task performance and what information has not been represented at all. As such, the different types of representation are likely used to solve different kinds of tasks. For example, structured representations are more complex and computationally demanding, but are good at representing relational information. Researchers interested in human psychology would benefit from considering how knowledge is represented in their domain of inquiry.This article is categorized under:

This contribution explores the first results of the European project <jats:italic>HOME</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>Home of Mobile Europeans</jats:italic>). The project, currently ongoing, is funded by the 2019 Key Action 2 Erasmus+ call and developed by six European partners. According to the digital transition planned by the Erasmus+ Programme, HOME supports EU mobility by providing students and trainees with a digitalized infrastructure that integrates the search for accommodation within existing European digital mobility initiatives, such as the Erasmus+ App. Moreover the project defines a set of living “quality labels” to increase the transparency of information about accommodation offer at the European level. Furthermore, educational resources and a training toolkit will be available, in the HOME website, to spread and replicate the project’s learnings results. Once operational, HOME will represent an essential digital solution for a more accessible and quality student accommodation offer."

Aerodynamic and thermodynamic phenomena are strongly coupled and relate to the heat loads that affect the vehicle along the re-entry trajectory, which drive the design of the thermal protection system (TPS). The preliminary design and optimization of re-entry vehicles would benefit from accurate high-fidelity aerothermodynamic analysis, which are usually expensive computational fluid dynamic simulations. We propose an original formulation for multifidelity active learning that considers both the information extracted from data and domain-specific knowledge. Our scheme is developed for the design of re-entry vehicles and is demonstrated for the case of an Orion-like capsule entering the Earth atmosphere. The design process aims to minimize the mass of propellant burned during the entry maneuver, the mass of the TPS, and the temperature experienced by the TPS along the re-entry. The results demonstrate that our multifidelity strategy allows to achieve a sensitive improvement of the design solution with respect to the baseline. In particular, the outcomes of our method are superior to the design obtained through a single-fidelity framework, as a result of the principled selection of a limited number of high-fidelity evaluations."

          We propose a formal operational semantics for service discovery and binding. This semantics is based on a graph-based representation of the configuration of global computers typed by business activities. Business activities execute distributed workflows that can trigger, at run time, the discovery, ranking and selection of services to which they bind, thus reconfiguring the workflows that they execute. Discovery, ranking and selection are based on compliance with required business and interaction protocols and optimisation of quality-of-service constraints. Binding and reconfiguration are captured as algebraic operations on configuration graphs. We also discuss the methodological implications that this model framework has on software engineering using a typical travel-booking scenario. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to provide a clear separation between service computation and discovery/instantiation/binding, and to offer a formal framework that is independent of the SOA middleware components that act as service registries or brokers, and the protocols through which bindings and invocations are performed."

Here, we investigate the impacts of increasing plant diversity in catch crop rotations on rhizosphere C input and microbial utilization. Mustard (<jats:italic>Sinapis alba</jats:italic> L.) planted as a single cultivar was compared to diversified catch crop mixtures of four (Mix4) or 12 species (Mix12). We traced the C transfer from shoots to roots towards the soil microbial community and the soil respiration in a <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C pulse labelling field experiment. Net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-C uptake from the atmosphere increased by two times in mix 4 and more than three times in mix 12. Higher net ecosystem C production was linked to increasing catch crop diversity and increased belowground transfer rates of recently fixed photoassimilates. The higher rhizosphere C input stimulated the growth and activity of the soil microbiome, which was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Total microbial biomass increased from 14 to 22 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> as compared to the fallow and was 18 and 8% higher for mix 12 and mix 4 as compared to mustard. In particular, the fungal and actinobacterial communities profited the most from the higher belowground C input and their biomass increased by 3.4 and 1.3 times as compared to the fallow. The residence time of the <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C pulse, traced in the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> flux from the soil environment, increased with plant diversity by up to 1.8 times. The results of this study suggest positive impacts of plant diversity on C cycling by higher atmospheric C uptake, higher transport rates towards the rhizosphere, higher microbial incorporation and prolonged residence time in the soil environment. We conclude that diversified catch crop mixtures improve the efficiency of C cycling in cropping systems and provide a promising tool for sustainable soil management."

To improve structural preservation of the tissue, we obtained samples from ventilated patients using a trans-bronchial “cryobiopsy” within 30 min after their death and fixed them immediately for electron microscopy. Samples of six COVID-19 patients with a documented histopathology were systematically investigated by thin section electron microscopy. The different samples and areas inspected revealed the ultrastructural correlates of the different phases of diffuse alveolar damage, including detachment of the alveolar epithelium, hyperplasia of type 2 cells, exudates, and accumulation of extracellular material, such as the hyaline membranes and fibrin. Macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes were regularly detected. Structural integrity of endothelium was intact in regions where the alveolar epithelium was already detached. Aggregates of erythrocytes, leukocytes with fibrin, and thrombocytes were not observed. Coronavirus particles were only found in and around very few cells in one of the six patient samples. The type and origin of these cells could not be assessed although the overall structural preservation of the samples allowed the identification of pulmonary cell types. Hence, the observed alveolar damage is not associated with virus presence or structural impairment due to ongoing replication at later stages of the disease in fatal cases, which implies that the lung damage in these patients is at least propagated by alternative mechanisms, perhaps, an inappropriate immune or stress response."

We deploy our model in a case-study to evaluate and analyse two carbon reduction policies, i.e., carbon-tax and cap-and-trade policies. The results demonstrate that our robust-heuristic methodology can efficiently deal with demand and economic uncertainty, especially in large-scale problems. Our findings suggest that governmental incentives for a cap-and-trade policy would be more effective for supply chains in lowering pollution by investing in cleaner technologies and adopting greener practices."

In each analysis, we investigate item and test information in particular, including analysis of differential item functioning on gender, age, site, and sample differences where applicable.

                Scales performed variably. Changes to items and scales are described. Several scales appeared to reliably discriminate individuals entering mental health treatment on severity, and others are less reliable. Marked improvements in scale internal consistency and measurement precision were observed between the first and second implemented versions.

                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                This system includes some scales with reasonable structural validity, though several areas for future development are identified. The system was developed to be iteratively re-evaluated, to strengthen the validity of its scales over time. There are currently a number of limitations on inferences from these scores, which future developments should address.

We specifically focus on the role of day care center and school closures, which may be regarded as a “disruptive exogenous shock” to family life. We make use of a novel representative survey of parental well-being collected in May and June 2020 in Germany, when schools and day care centers were closed but while other measures had been relaxed and new infections were low. In our descriptive analysis, we compare well-being during this period with a pre-crisis period for different groups. In a difference-in-differences design, we compare the change for individuals with children to the change for individuals without children, accounting for unrelated trends as well as potential survey mode and context effects. We find that the crisis lowered the relative well-being of individuals with children, especially for individuals with young children, for women, and for persons with lower secondary schooling qualifications. Our results suggest that public policy measures taken to contain Covid-19 can have large effects on family well-being, with implications for child development and parental labor market outcomes."

The correlation between monograph citations and tweets is also investigated. The number of citations and tweets measured in 2014 reveal a slight open access advantage, but the influence of language or subject should also be taken into account.

An investigation of the research output of Finnish universities,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R187767,Information Science,"Scientific articles available in Open Access (OA) have been found to attract more citations and online attention to the extent that it has become common to speak about OA Altmetrics Advantage. This research investigates how the OA Altmetrics Advantage holds for a specific case of research articles, namely the research outputs from universities in Finland. Furthermore, this research examines disciplinary and platform specific differences in that (dis)advantage. The new methodological approaches developed in this research focus on relative visibility, i.e. how often articles in OA journals receive at least one mention on the investigated online platforms, and relative receptivity, i.e. how frequently articles in OA journals gain mentions in comparison to articles in subscription-based journals. The results show significant disciplinary and platform specific differences in the OA advantage, with articles in OA journals within for instance veterinary sciences, social and economic geography and psychology receiving more citations and attention on social media platforms, while the opposite was found for articles in OA journals within medicine and health sciences. The results strongly support field- and platform-specific considerations when assessing the influence of journal OA status on altmetrics. The new methodological approaches used in this research will serve future comparative research into OA advantage of scientific articles over time and between countries."

However, scholars encounter problems in finding relevant information about upcoming events and statistics on their historic evolution.
In order to obtain a better understanding of scholarly event characteristics in four fields of science, we analyzed the metadata of scholarly events of four major fields of science, namely Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics using Scholarly Events Quality Assessment suite, a suite of ten metrics.
In particular, we analyzed renowned scholarly events belonging to five sub-fields within Computer Science, namely World Wide Web, Computer Vision, Software Engineering, Data Management, as well as Security and Privacy.
This analysis is based on a systematic approach using descriptive statistics as well as exploratory data analysis. The findings are on the one hand interesting to observe the general evolution and success factors of scholarly events; on the other hand, they allow (prospective) event organizers, publishers, and committee members to assess the progress of their event over time and compare it to other events in the same field; and finally, they help researchers to make more informed decisions when selecting suitable venues for presenting their work.
Based on these findings, a set of recommendations has been concluded to different stakeholders, involving event organizers, potential authors, proceedings publishers, and sponsors. Our comprehensive dataset of scholarly events of the aforementioned fields is openly available in a semantic format and maintained collaboratively at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://OpenResearch.org"">OpenResearch.org</jats:ext-link>."

Results and methodological reflections of an application of multiple measures to an analysis by WoS subject areas,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R187760,Information Science,"This study is one of the first that uses the recently introduced open access (OA) labels in the Web of Science (WoS) metadata to investigate whether OA articles published in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) listed journals experience a citation advantage in comparison to subscription journal articles, specifically those of which no self-archived versions are available. Bibliometric data on all articles and reviews indexed in WoS, and published from 2013 to 2015, were analysed. In addition to normalised citation score (NCS), we used two additional measures of citation advantage: whether an article was cited at all; and whether an article is among the most frequently cited percentile of articles within its respective subject area (pptopX %). For each WoS subject area, the strength of the relationship between access status (whether an article was published in an OA journal) and each of these three measures was calculated. We found that OA journal articles experience a citation advantage in very few subject areas and, in most of these subject areas, the citation advantage was found on only a single measure of citation advantage, namely whether the article was cited at all. Our results lead us to conclude that access status accounts for little of the variability in the number of citations an article accumulates. The methodology and the calculations that were used in this study are described in detail and we believe that the lessons we learnt, and the recommendations we make, will be of much use to future researchers interested in using the WoS OA labels, and to the field of citation advantage in general."

A bibliometric analysis,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R187789,Information Science,"In recent years, increased stakeholder pressure to transition research to Open Access has led to many journals converting, or ‘flipping’, from a closed access (CA) to an open access (OA) publishing model. Changing the publishing model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour. In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model influences the journal’s future publication volumes and citation impact. We analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level: the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC), respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups. However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall, these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring positive changes to a journal."

We did this by comparing (i) the share of open and non-open access documents in different Climate Action topics, and their news counts, and (ii) the mean of news counts for open access and non-open access documents. The data set of this study comprised 70,206 articles and reviews in Sustainable Development Goal 13, published during 2014–2018, retrieved from SciVal. The number of news mentions for each document was obtained from Altmetrics Details Page API using their DOIs, whereas the open access statuses were obtained using Unpaywall.org. The analysis in this paper was done using a combination of (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic modelling, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis. The covariates included in the regression analysis were features related to authors, country, journal, institution, funding, readability, news source category and topic. Using topic modelling, we identified 10 topics, with topics 4 (meteorology) [21%], 5 (adaption, mitigation, and legislation) [18%] and 8 (ecosystems and biodiversity) [14%] accounting for 53% of the research in Sustainable Development Goal 13. Additionally, the results of regression analysis showed that while keeping all the variables constant in the model, open access papers in Climate Action had a news count advantage (8.8%) in comparison to non-open access papers. Our findings also showed that while a higher share of open access documents in topics such as topic 9 (Human vulnerability to risks) might not assist with its broader dissemination, in some others such as topic 5 (adaption, mitigation, and legislation), even a lower share of open access documents might accelerate its broad communication via news outlets."

The findings show the relative and absolute subject coverages of 56 databases—information that has often not been available before. Knowing the databases’ <jats:italic>absolute</jats:italic> subject coverage allows the selection of the most comprehensive databases for searches requiring high recall/sensitivity, particularly relevant in lookup or exploratory searches. Knowing the databases’ <jats:italic>relative</jats:italic> subject coverage allows the selection of specialized databases for searches requiring high precision/specificity, particularly relevant in systematic searches. The findings illustrate not only differences in the disciplinary coverage of Google Scholar, Scopus, or Web of Science, but also of less frequently analyzed databases. For example, researchers might be surprised how Meta (discontinued), Embase, or Europe PMC are found to cover more records than PubMed in Medicine and other health subjects. These findings should encourage researchers to re-evaluate their go-to databases, also against newly introduced options. Searching with more comprehensive databases can improve finding, particularly when selecting the most fitting databases needs particular thought, such as in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This comparison can also help librarians and other information experts re-evaluate expensive database procurement strategies. Researchers without institutional access learn which open databases are likely most comprehensive in their disciplines."

In the current study, we evaluated body shape divergence of the New Mexico State‐threatened White Sands pupfish (<jats:italic>Cyprinodon tularosa</jats:italic>) that were introduced to brackish, lacustrine habitats at two different time in the recent past (approximately 30 years and 1 year previously) from the same source population (saline river environment). Pupfish body shape is correlated with environmental salinity: fish from saline habitats are characterized by slender body shapes, whereas fish from fresher, yet brackish springs are deep‐bodied. In this study, lacustrine populations consisted of an approximately 30‐year old population and several 1‐year old populations, all introduced from the same source. The body shape divergence of the 30‐year old population was significant and greater than any of the divergences of the 1‐year old populations (which were for the most part not significant). Nonetheless, all body shape changes exhibited body deepening in less saline environments. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity potentially facilitates directional evolution of body deepening for introduced pupfish populations."

Our research aims were to characterize the changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and chronic care facilities."

The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. It is investigated, how the thickness of the cladding and the type of cooling after hot forming (in air or in water) affect the properties of the cladding. The hybrid shafts are formed without layer separation. However, slight core loosening occurres in the area of the bearing seat due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly effected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite. In the base material, air cooling results in a mainly ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite. Quenching in water results in a microstructure containing mainly martensite."

Within the current study, we applied the concept of psychological distance to understand the distance towards COVID-19 and investigated its (1) connection with preventive attitudes and proactive behaviors, (2) context-specific antecedents, and its (3) mediating effect of knowledge on attitudes. Using an online sample from a German quantitative cross-sectional study (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 395, <jats:italic>M</jats:italic> = 32.2 years, <jats:italic>SD</jats:italic> = 13.9 years, 64.3% female) in July 2020, a time with a general low incidence of people infected with Sars-CoV2, we measured relevant socio-psychological constructs addressing COVID-19 and included further information from external sources. Based on a path model, we found geographical distance as a significant predictor of cognitive attitudes towards COVID-19. Furthermore, hypothetical distance (i.e., feeling to be likely affected by COVID-19) predicted not only participants’ affective, cognitive, and behavioral attitudes, but also the installation of a corona warning-app. While several variables affected the different dimensions of psychological distance, hypothetical and geographical distance mediated the effect of knowledge on attitudes. These results underline the role of geographical and hypothetical distance for health-related behaviors and education. For example, people will only comply with preventive measures if they feel geographically concerned by the disease, which is particularly challenging for fast-spreading global diseases such as COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need to clearly communicate the personal risks of diseases and address peoples’ hypothetical distance."

Majority of the existing techniques are mainly domain-specific, which require application domain knowledge and employ higher order statistical methods, and computationally expensive and require large train data, which is rare for many applications. Overcoming these issues, this paper proposes a new unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique. The proposed unsupervised keyphrase extraction technique, named <jats:italic>TeKET</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>Tree-based Keyphrase Extraction Technique</jats:italic>, is a domain-independent technique that employs limited statistical knowledge and requires no train data. This technique also introduces a new variant of a binary tree, called <jats:italic>KeyPhrase Extraction</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>KePhEx</jats:italic>) tree, to extract final keyphrases from candidate keyphrases. In addition, a measure, called <jats:italic>Cohesiveness Index</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>CI</jats:italic>, is derived which denotes a given node’s degree of cohesiveness with respect to the root. The CI is used in flexibly extracting final keyphrases from the KePhEx tree and is co-utilized in the ranking process. The effectiveness of the proposed technique and its domain and language independence are experimentally evaluated using available benchmark corpora, namely SemEval-2010 (a scientific articles dataset), Theses100 (a thesis dataset), and a <jats:italic>German Research Article</jats:italic> dataset, respectively. The acquired results are compared with other relevant unsupervised techniques belonging to both statistical and graph-based techniques.

We examine crop, income, and dietary data collected from 1106 farmer households across Gujarat and Haryana, two states that represent different livelihood transition pathways in India. Regression results suggest that crop diversity had a positive association with dietary diversity among adults (both men and women) in both states, and among adolescents and children in Haryana. Higher family education and annual income were the two most important factors associated with higher dietary diversity score (DDS) in Gujarat whereas, higher family education, greater crop diversity, and increased distance traveled to markets were the most important factors associated with higher individual DDS in Haryana. Specifically, for children, crop diversity emerged as one of the most important factors associated with dietary diversity in both states. Interestingly, we find that even in these two relatively prosperous states, the pathways to dietary diversity vary across sites and within households, suggesting that policies to improve dietary diversity should be tailored to a given location and context."

Epistemic tolerance stands for the mental attitude of an epistemic agent, e.g., a scientist, who is open to opposing views, while epistemic authoritarianism represents the tendency to uncritically accept views of authorities. Another relevant epistemic factor when it comes to the epistemic decisions of scientists is the skepticism towards the scientific method. However, the question is whether these epistemic attitudes are influenced by their sociopolitical counterparts, such as the researcher’s degree of conservatism. To empirically investigate the interplay between epistemic and sociopolitical attitudes of scientists, we conducted a survey with researchers (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 655) across different disciplines. We propose scales for measuring epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism, as well as a scale for detecting the participants' readiness to question the scientific method. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between epistemic tolerance and epistemic authoritarianism on the one hand, and career stage and sociopolitical views on the other hand. Interestingly, our study found only small correlations between the participants' degree of conservatism and their epistemic attitudes. This suggests that political views, against common argumentation, actually do not play an important role in one’s scientific decisions. Moreover, social scientists scored higher on the epistemic tolerance and lower on the epistemic authoritarianism scale than natural scientists. Finally, the results indicate that natural scientists question the scientific method less than social scientists."

Yet, the allergenic potential of these urban ecosystems, in particular spontaneous vegetation outside parks and gardens, remains poorly known. We quantified the allergenic properties of 56 dry grasslands along a double gradient of urbanisation and plant invasion in Berlin (Germany). 30% of grassland species were classified as allergenic, most of them being natives. Urbanisation was associated with an increase in abundance and diversity of pollen allergens, mainly driven by an increase in allergenic non-native plants. While not inherently more allergenic than native plants, the pool of non-natives contributed a larger biochemical diversity of allergens and flowered later than natives, creating a broader potential spectrum of allergy. Managing novel risks to urban public health will involve not only targeted action on allergenic non-natives, but also policies at the habitat scale favouring plant community assembly of a diverse, low-allergenicity vegetation. Similar approaches could be easily replicated in other cities to provide a broad quantification and mapping of urban allergy risks and drivers."

The objective of this study was to understand how the combination of crop diversification practices influences the performance of arable crop sequences in terms of crop grain yield, crop and weed biomass, and nitrogen acquisition in a temperate climate. Two field experiments were carried out. The first was a 3-year crop sequence with cereal or grain legume as the first crops, with and without undersown forage legumes and forage legume-grass crops, followed by a cereal crop. The second experiment was a 2-year crop sequence with cereal or legume as the first crops, a legume cover crop, and a subsequent cereal crop. For the first time, crop diversification practices were combined to identify plant-plant interactions in spatial and temporal scales. The results partly confirm the positive effect of diversifying cereal-based cropping systems by including grain legumes and cover crops in the crop sequence. Legume cover crops had a positive effect on subsequent cereal grain yield in one of the experiments. Using faba beans as the first crop in the crop sequence had both a positive and no effect on crop biomass and N acquisition of the subsequent cereal. In cover crops composed of a forage legume-grass mixture, the grass biomass and N acquisition were consistently increased after the grain legume, compared to the cereal-preceding crop. However, differences in the proportion of legume to grass in mixture did not influence crop yield or N acquisition in the subsequent cereal. In conclusion, these results support that increased crop diversity across spatial and temporal scales can contribute to resource-efficient production and enhance the delivery of services, contributing to more sustainable cropping systems."

The analysis studied data of adult patients who underwent diagnosis over the past few years, and developed a hybrid approach, consisting of two different models: a machine learning model obtained by training on data of past cases; and a knowledge model capturing the expertise of medical experts through knowledge engineering. The resulting algorithm has an accuracy of 95% on data currently available, and is currently being tested in a clinical environment."

The tasks for the city administration have become more complex, whereas tools and methods are often based on traditional, static approaches while involving a limited number of citizens and stakeholders in relevant decisions. The digital transformation of more and more pieces of the planning and decision-making process will make both increasingly more illustrative, easier to understand and more comprehensible. An important data basis for these processes is the digital twin of the City of Zurich. 3D spatial data and their models transform themes of the city, such as buildings, bridges, vegetation, etc., to the digital world, are being updated when required, and create advantages in digital space. These benefits need to be highlighted and published. An important step in public awareness is the release of 3D spatial data under Open Government Data. This allows the development of applications, the promotion of understanding, and the simplification of the creation of different collaborative platforms. By visualization and analysis of digital prototypes and the demonstration of interactions with the built environment, scenarios can be digitally developed and discussed in decision-making bodies. Questions about the urban climate can be simulated with the help of the digital twin and results can be linked to the existing 3D spatial data. Thus, the 3D spatial data set, the models and their descriptions through metadata become the reference and must be updated according to the requirements. Depending on requirements and questions, further 3D spatial data must be added. The description of the 3D spatial data and their models or the lifecycle management of the digital twin must be carried out with great care. Only in this way, decision processes can be supported in a comprehensible way."

This contribution outlines AI-based techniques for 3D point clouds and geospatial digital twins as generic components of geospatial AI. First, we briefly reflect on the term “AI” and outline technology developments needed to apply AI to IT solutions, seen from a software engineering perspective. Next, we characterize 3D point clouds as key category of geodata and their role for creating the basis for geospatial digital twins; we explain the feasibility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for 3D point clouds. In particular, we argue that 3D point clouds can be seen as a corpus with similar properties as natural language corpora and formulate a “Naturalness Hypothesis” for 3D point clouds. In the main part, we introduce a workflow for interpreting 3D point clouds based on ML/DL approaches that derive domain-specific and application-specific semantics for 3D point clouds without having to create explicit spatial 3D models or explicit rule sets. Finally, examples are shown how ML/DL enables us to efficiently build and maintain base data for geospatial digital twins such as virtual 3D city models, indoor models, or building information models."

However, because of the necessity of evaluating expensive black-box simulations, the enormous computational cost of solving MDO problems in aerospace systems has also become a problem in practice. To resolve this, metamodel-based design optimization techniques have been applied to MDO. With these methods, system models can be rapidly predicted using approximate metamodels to improve the optimization efficiency. This paper presents an overall survey of metamodel-based MDO for aerospace systems. From the perspective of aerospace system design, this paper introduces the fundamental methodology and technology of metamodel-based MDO, including aerospace system MDO problem formulation, metamodeling techniques, state-of-the-art metamodel-based multidisciplinary optimization strategies, and expensive black-box constraint-handling mechanisms. Moreover, various aerospace system examples are presented to illustrate the application of metamodel-based MDOs to practical engineering. The conclusions derived from this work are summarized in the final section of the paper. The survey results are expected to serve as guide and reference for designers involved in metamodel-based MDO in the field of aerospace engineering."

Expert systems and knowledge bases were all results of these efforts. The initial efforts on knowledge bases were focused on defining a domain and task intensionally with rather complex ontologies. The increasing complexity of knowledge and knowledge-based systems eventually led to the development of knowledge engineering methodologies. Knowledge graphs, in contrast to the traditional knowledge bases, represent knowledge more extensionally with a very large set of explicit statements and rather simpler and smaller ontologies. This paradigm change calls for a new take on knowledge engineering that focuses on the curation of ABox statements. In this paper, we introduce various aspects of the knowledge graphs lifecycle namely creation, hosting, curation and deployment. We define each task, give example approaches from the literature and explain our approach with a running example.

Subjective experiences related to the eating disorder (e.g. urge to restrict, feeling full etc.) were assessed before and after rTMS. Non-parametric repeated measures tests were used. rTMS was safe and well-tolerated, and resulted in reduced levels of feeling full, feeling fat and feeling anxious. Thus, rTMS may reduce core symptoms of anorexia nervosa. Future research should establish the therapeutic potential of rTMS in anorexia nervosa."

To overcome these challenges, a Web application for pest control is proposed to facilitate the integration of information coming from different Internet sources and representing different terminologies by using an ontology. The application is based on a pest-control ontology (formal representations of domain knowledge that can be interpreted by computers) that accounts for various pesticide regulations of different countries to which the crop is exported.

We measured beginning learners’ eye movements during sentence processing to investigate whether or not they actually attend to irregular verb features and, if so, whether the amount of attention that they pay to these features predicts their acquisition. On the assumption that attention facilitates learning (e.g., Gass, 1997; Robinson, 2003; Schmidt, 2001), we expected more attention (i.e., longer fixations or more frequent comparisons between verb forms) to lead to more learning of the irregular verbs. Forty beginning learners of German read 12 German sentence pairs with stem-changing verbs and 12 German sentence pairs with regular verbs while an Eyelink 1000 recorded their eye movements. The stem-changing verbs consisted of six<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>→<jats:italic>ä</jats:italic>changing verbs and six<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>→<jats:italic>i(e)</jats:italic>changing verbs. Each verb appeared in a baseline sentence in the first-person singular, which has no stem change, and a critical sentence in the second- or third-person singular, which have a stem change for the irregular but not the regular verbs, on the same screen. Productive pre- and posttests measured the effects of exposure on learning. Results indicate that learners looked longer overall at stem-changing verbs than regular verbs, revealing a late effect of verb irregularity on reading times. Longer total times had a modest, favorable effect on the subsequent production of the stem vowel. Finally, the production of only the<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>→<jats:italic>ä</jats:italic>verbs—not the<jats:italic>e</jats:italic>→<jats:italic>i(e)</jats:italic>verbs—benefited from direct visual comparisons during reading, possibly because of the umlaut in the former.

Often searchers intuitively choose keywords according to their knowledge on the search interest which may limit the coverage of the retrieval. Although one can identify additional keywords via reading patent texts from prior searches to refine the query terms heuristically, the process is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. In this paper, we propose a method to automate and augment the heuristic and iterative keyword discovery process. Specifically, we train a semantic engineering knowledge graph on the full patent database using natural language processing and semantic analysis, and use it as the basis to retrieve and rank the keywords contained in the retrieved patents. On this basis, searchers do not need to read patent texts but just select among the recommended keywords to expand their queries.

This became central in the moral panic from 2000 onwards over a supposed proliferation of homosexuality.<jats:italic>Anusocratie</jats:italic>links such same-sex practices to illicit enrichment by the national elites and their involvement with secret associations of Western provenance, such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucians and the Illuminati. This article tries to unravel this conceptual knot of homosexuality, the occult (Freemasonry) and illicit enrichment: first, by historicizing it. Of interest in the Cameroonian case is the fact that a similar link is mentioned in one of the first ethnographies, Günther Tessmann's<jats:italic>Die Pangwe</jats:italic>. Freemasonry is clearly a colonial imposition on the country, but the link between same-sex practices and enrichment has a longer history. Second, a comparison with similar ideas elsewhere on the continent can also open up wider perspectives. The link with illicit enrichment does not figure in classical conceptions of ‘homosexuality’ as developed in Europe, yet it strongly emerges from examples from all over Africa. Both Achille Mbembe and Joseph Tonda show that this image of the anus – anal penetration – articulates popular concerns about staggering inequalities. Yet, this aspect is ignored in debates about growing ‘homophobia’ in Africa. A confrontation with classical texts from Western queer theory (Bersani, Mieli) can help us discover other layers in African discourses, notably an emphasis on sexual diversity as an answer to homophobia. It can also serve to relativize the linking of sexual practices to sexual identities, which is still seen as self-evident in much queer theory of Western provenance."

Relevant scientific articles were searched in PUBMED, EMBASE, SCIENCE DIRECT, LILACS, WEB OF SCIENCE and SCOPUS. Observational studies that included the measurement of any CMR factor in healthy adolescents and dietary patterns were included. The search strategy retained nineteen articles for qualitative analysis. Among retained articles, the effects of dietary pattern on the means of BMI (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 18), waist circumference (WC) (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 9), systolic blood pressure (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 7), diastolic blood pressure (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 6), blood glucose (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 5) and lipid profile (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> 5) were examined. Systematised evidence showed that an unhealthy dietary pattern appears to be associated with poor mean values of CMR factors among adolescents. However, evidence of a protective effect of healthier dietary patterns in this group remains unclear. Considering the number of studies with available information, a meta-analysis of anthropometric measures showed that dietary patterns characterised by the highest intake of unhealthy foods resulted in a higher mean BMI (0·57 kg/m²; 95 % CI 0·51, 0·63) and WC (0·57 cm; 95 % CI 0·47, 0·67) compared with low intake of unhealthy foods. Controversially, patterns characterised by a low intake of healthy foods were associated with a lower mean BMI (−0·41 kg/m²; 95 % CI −0·46,−0·36) and WC (−0·43 cm; 95 % CI −0·52,−0·33). An unhealthy dietary pattern may influence markers of CMR among adolescents, but considering the small number and limitations of the studies included, further studies are warranted to strengthen the evidence of this relation."

A method of plotting the data (called cusums) is suggested which makes it easier to see the effect of small epidemics.Cusums for GP statistics and respiratory deaths were found to be the most helpful indices for describing both size and timing of the epidemics, followed by total deaths and SBC, which were less specific to influenza, and influenza deaths, which lagged behind other indices. Deaths certified as pneumonia have been increasing over these years, whereas bronchitis deaths have been decreasing and these indices should not be used separately for monitoring.The laboratory reporting system is important. It confirms the presence of influenza virus in the community and indicates prevalent strains. Because it is a voluntary system with no defined population base the reports are not reliable numerically for estimating relative size of epidemics or for developing cusums.Cusum plots were unanimous in describing the winter of 1980/1 as one of little influenza activity."

Therefore, 12 morphological characters were examined and 34 metric and weight ratios were defined. In addition to the classic morphological characters, populations were compared by the thickness of the nacreous layer. Results of Duncan's multiple comparison test showed that the most discriminative ratios were the width of nacreous layer of right valve to the inflation of shell, the hinge line length to the maximum width of shell and the nacre thickness to the maximum width of shell. The analysis of variance revealed an important inter-population morphological variability.

It includes administrative, medical, nursing, and laboratory applications with their relational databases. Among available patient databases, clinical microbiology laboratory and admission-discharge-transfer (ADT) databases are used to generate computer alerts. A laboratory alert (lab alert) is printed daily in the Infection Control Program (ICP) offices, listing all patients with cultures positive for MRSA detected within the preceding 24 hours. Patients might be either newly detected patients colonized or infected with MRSA, or previously recognized MRSA patients having surveillance cultures. The ICP nurses subsequently go to the ward or call the ward personnel to implement ICM. A second alert, the “readmission alert,” detects readmission to the hospital of any patient previously colonized or infected with MRSA by periodic queries (q 1 min) to the ADT database. The readmission alert is printed in the ICP offices, but also forwarded with added guidelines to the emergency room.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> During the first 12 months of application (July 1994 to June 1995), the lab alert detected an average of 4.6 isolates per day, corresponding to 314 hospital admissions (248 patients); the use of this alert saved time for the ICP nurses by improving work organization. There were 438 readmission alerts (1.2 alerts per day) over the study period; of 347 patients screened immediately upon readmission, 114 (33%) were positive for MRSA carriage. Delayed recognition of readmitted MRSA carriers decreased significantly after the implementation of this alert; the proportion of MRSA patients recognized at the time of admission to the hospital increased from 13% in 1993 to 40% in 1995 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;.001).<jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Hospital information system-based alerts can play an important role in the surveillance and early prevention of MRSA transmission, and it can help to recognize patterns of colonization and transmission."

especially on their problem-solving capacities, to learn a second language. The hypothesis
implies that only adults with a high level of verbal analytical ability will reach near-native
competence in their second language, but that this ability will not be a significant predictor of
success for childhood second language acquisition. A study with 57 adult Hungarian-speaking
immigrants confirmed the hypothesis in the sense that very few adult immigrants scored within
the range of child arrivals on a grammaticality judgment test, and that the few who did had high
levels of verbal analytical ability; this ability was not a significant predictor for childhood
arrivals. This study replicates the findings of Johnson and Newport (1989) and provides an
explanation for the apparent exceptions in their study. These findings lead to a

Evaluation of human and animal health surveillance programmes around the world is currently not standardized and therefore inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to review surveillance system attributes and the methods used for their assessment, together with the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks for evaluating surveillance in animal health, public health and allied disciplines. Information from 99 articles describing the evaluation of 101 surveillance systems was examined. A wide range of approaches for assessing 23 different system attributes was identified although most evaluations addressed only one or two attributes and comprehensive evaluations were uncommon. Surveillance objectives were often not stated in the articles reviewed and so the reasons for choosing certain attributes for assessment were not always apparent. This has the potential to introduce misleading results in surveillance evaluation. Due to the wide range of system attributes that may be assessed, methods should be explored which collapse these down into a small number of grouped characteristics by focusing on the relationships between attributes and their links to the objectives of the surveillance system and the evaluation. A generic and comprehensive evaluation framework could then be developed consisting of a limited number of common attributes together with several sets of secondary attributes which could be selected depending on the disease or range of diseases under surveillance and the purpose of the surveillance. Economic evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance evaluation process. This would provide a significant benefit to decision-makers who often need to make choices based on limited or diminishing resources."

The purpose of this study was to assess several surveillance systems within the same industry using the semi-quantitative OASIS method and to compare the results of the assessments in order to propose improvements, including future synergies. We have focused on the surveillance of three major equine diseases in France. We have identified the mutual and specific strengths and weaknesses of each surveillance system. Furthermore, the comparative assessment has highlighted many possible synergies that could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of surveillance as a whole, including the implementation of new joint tools or the pooling of existing teams, tools or skills. Our approach is an original application of the OASIS method, which requires minimal financial resources and is not very time-consuming. Such a comparative evaluation could conceivably be applied to other surveillance systems, other industries and other countries. This approach would be especially relevant to enhance the efficiency of surveillance activities when resources are limited."

MiBa automatically collects microbiological test results from all Danish DCMs. We built an algorithm to identify positive test results for CD recorded in MiBa. A CD case was defined as a person with a positive culture for CD or PCR detection of toxin A and/or B and/or binary toxin. We compared CD cases identified through the MiBa-based surveillance with those reported to NREP and locally in five DCMs representing different Danish regions. During 2010–2014, NREP reported 13 896 CD cases, and the MiBa-based surveillance 21 252 CD cases. There was a 99·9% concordance between the local datasets and the MiBa-based surveillance. Surveillance based on MiBa was superior to the current surveillance system, and the findings show that the number of CD cases in Denmark hitherto has been under-reported. There were only minor differences between local data and the MiBa-based surveillance, showing the completeness and validity of CD data in MiBa. This nationwide electronic system can greatly strengthen surveillance and research in various applications."

This article presents findings from a small-scale case study that aimed at exploring the nature of teachers’ asynchronous exchanges in a discussion list. The data comprised the archived log of the messages in a Yahoo Group discussion list by five in-service English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers who volunteered to take part in a hybrid computer-assisted language learning (CALL) teacher education course in a state university in Iran. The discussion list was incorporated into the course to engage participants in professional dialogue on topics related to technology/CALL. During the initial data analysis, participants’ asynchronous exchanges were grouped as suggestions, questions, unclassified, answers, and delivery, drawing upon Oriogun and Cave’s (2008) SQUAD categorization, following the constant comparative method of analysis. Through a follow-up computer-mediated discourse analysis, cognitive, social, and teaching presence functional moves were identified in the data. Participants used the space not only for socializing and peer instruction but also for constructing knowledge. Despite an uneven pattern of contribution, asynchronous exchanges provided opportunities for knowledge construction at different levels of cognitive presence on topics ranging from technology tools and their affordances/constraints to computer-assisted language testing, materials development, and classroom management. The findings provide CALL teacher education researchers and course designers insights into the potential of asynchronous interaction for online and blended language teacher education."

These initiatives are complicated by fundamental problems of definitions of terms, ambiguity of concepts, lack of standardization in methods of data collection, and inadequate attempts to strengthen the analytic capability of field organizations. Cross-cutting issues in needs assessment, coordination, and evaluation illustrate additional recurring challenges in dealing with evidence in humanitarian assistance. These challenges include lack of agency expertise, dyscoordination at the field level, inappropriate reliance on indicators that measure process rather than outcome, flawed scientific inference, and erosion of the concept of minimum standards.Decision-making in disaster management currently places a premium on expert or eminence-based decisions. By contrast, scientific advances in disaster medicine call for evidence-based decisions whose strength of evidence is established by the methods of data acquisition. At present, disaster relief operations may be data driven, but that does not mean that they are soundly evidence-based.Options for strengthening evidence-based activities include rigorously adhering to evidenced-based interventions, using evidence-based tools to identify new approaches to problems of concern, studying model programs as well as failed ones to identify approaches that deserve replication, and improving standards for evidence of effectiveness in disaster science and services."

This will result in a range of spectral lines being resolved for the first time in celestial sources, especially in the Fe region. However, a large number of X-ray line energies in the atomic databases are known to a lesser accuracy than that expected for Astro-H/SXS, or have no known uncertainty at all. To benchmark the available calculations, we have therefore started to measure reference energies of K-shell transition in L-shell ions for astrophysically relevant elements in the range 11≤ Z ≤ 28 (Na to Ni), using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's EBIT-I electron beam ion trap coupled with the NASA/GSFC EBIT calorimeter spectrometer (ECS).

On the basis of our recent measurements during the German Arabian Sea Process Study as part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) in 1995 and 1997, we present estimates of various N sources and sinks such as atmospheric dry and wet depositions of N aerosols, pelagic denitrification, nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) emissions, and advective N input from the south. Additionally, we estimated the N burial in the deep sea and the sedimentary shelf denitrification. On the basis of our measurements and literature data, the N budget for the Arabian Sea was reassessed. It is dominated by the N loss due to denitrification, which is balanced by the advective input of N from the south. The role of N fixation in the Arabian Sea is still difficult to assess owing to the small database available; however, there are hints that it might be more important than previously thought. Atmospheric N depositions are important on a regional scale during the intermonsoon in the central Arabian Sea; however, they play only a minor role for the overall N cycling. Emissions of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and ammonia, deep‐sea N burial, and N inputs by rivers and marginal seas (i.e., Persian Gulf and Red Sea) are of minor importance. We found that the magnitude of the sedimentary denitrification at the shelf might be ∼17% of the total denitrification in the Arabian Sea, indicating that the shelf sediments might be of considerably greater importance for the N cycling in the Arabian Sea than previously thought. Sedimentary and pelagic denitrification together demand ∼6% of the estimated particulate organic nitrogen export flux from the photic zone. The main northward transport of N into the Arabian Sea occurs in the intermediate layers, indicating that the N cycle of the Arabian Sea might be sensitive to variations of the intermediate water circulation of the Indian Ocean."

We examined the relationship between primary production and dinitrogen fixation together with diazotroph community structure in the oligotrophic western and eastern South Pacific Ocean and found that dinitrogen fixation was higher than nitrate‐based new production. Primary production increased in the middle of the western subtropical region, where the cyanobacterium <jats:italic>Trichodesmium</jats:italic> dominated the diazotroph community and accounted for up to 7.8% of the phytoplankton community, and the abundance of other phytoplankton taxa (especially <jats:italic>Prochlorococcus</jats:italic>) was high. These results suggest that regenerated production was enhanced by nitrogen released from <jats:italic>Trichodesmium</jats:italic> and that carbon fixation by <jats:italic>Trichodesmium</jats:italic> also contributed significantly to total primary production. Although volumetric dinitrogen fixation was comparable between the western and eastern subtropical regions, primary production in the western waters was more than twice as high as that in the eastern waters, where UCYN‐A1 (photoheterotroph) and heterotrophic bacteria were the dominant diazotrophs. This suggests that dinitrogen fixed by these diazotrophs contributed relatively little to primary production of the wider community, and there was limited carbon fixation by these diazotrophs. Hence, we document how the community composition of diazotrophs in the field can be reflected in how much nitrogen becomes available to the wider phytoplankton community and in how much autotrophic diazotrophs themselves fix carbon and thereby influences the magnitude of local primary production."

In this context sea level projections are key tools to help risk mitigation and adaptation. Projections are often made using models of the main contributors to sea level rise (e.g., thermal expansion, glaciers, and ice sheets). To obtain the total sea level these contributions are added; therefore, the uncertainty of total sea level depends on the correlation between the uncertainties of the contributors. This fact is important to understand the differences in the uncertainty of sea level projections from different methods. Using two process‐based models to project sea level for the 21st century, we show how to model the correlation structure and its time dependence. In these models the correlation primarily arises from uncertainty of future global mean surface temperature that correlates with almost all contributors. Assuming that sea level contributors are independent of each other, an assumption made in many sea level projections underestimates the uncertainty in sea level projections. As a result, high‐end low probability events that are important for decision making are underestimated. The uncertainty in the strength of the dependence between contributors is also explored. New dependence relations between the uncertainty of dynamical processes and surface mass balance in glaciers and ice sheets are introduced in our model. Total sea level uncertainty is found to be as sensitive to the dependence between contributors as to uncertainty in certain individual contributors like thermal expansion and Greenland ice sheet."

We found for the first time that primary production in the BoB is higher, and it is supported by dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) transported from the shelf regions through eddies. Both DON and DOP contribute up to 70–99% to the total dissolved nutrients in the waters above the thermocline. DON and DOP displayed positive relationship with primary production in the upper 25 m of water column, suggesting that organic nutrients significantly support primary producers. Primary production and export production in the BoB is comparable to that in the Arabian Sea, in contrast to the earlier belief that it has low production due to lack of inorganic nutrients caused by strong salinity stratification."

The CE‐4 ground penetrating radar reveals that fine‐grained regolith, coarse impact ejecta, and fractured bedrocks lie beneath the exploration path of the Yutu‐2 rover. The variations of regolith permittivity with depth and the radargrams indicate that the CE‐4 site has a fine‐grained regolith layer thickness of 11.1 m, which is about 1.3–3 times higher than the in situ measurement results at the Apollo and Chang'e‐3 (CE‐3) sites except for Apollo 16, possibly due to a faster weathering rate of ejecta deposits compared with coherent basalt substrates. The penetration depth of CE‐4 is about 2.85 times (in terms of round‐way delay) deeper than CE‐3, probably due to the differences in abundances of ilmenite and rocks in the regolith."

Geological text classification provides opportunities to leverage this wealth of data for geology and mineralization research. Existing studies of massive geoscience documents/reports have not provided effective classification results for further knowledge discovery and data mining and often lack adequate domain‐specific knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel and unified framework (namely, Dic‐Att‐BiLSTM) that combines domain‐specific knowledge and bidirectional long short‐term memory (BiLSTM) for effective geological text classification. Dic‐Att‐BiLSTM benefits from a matching strategy by incorporating domain‐specific knowledge developed based on geoscience ontology to grasp the linguistic geoscience clues. Furthermore, Dic‐Att‐BiLSTM brings together the capacity of a geoscience dictionary matching approach and an attention mechanism to construct a dictionary attention layer. Finally, the network framework of Dic‐Att‐BiLSTM can utilize domain‐specific knowledge and classify geological text automatically. Experimental verifications are conducted on two constructed data sets, and the results clearly indicate that Dic‐Att‐BiLSTM outperforms other state‐of‐the‐art text classification models."

We analyze changes in drought across the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff) in projections from Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The multimodel ensemble shows robust drying in the mean state across many regions and metrics by the end of the 21st century, even following the more aggressive mitigation pathways (SSP1‐2.6 and SSP2‐4.5). Regional hotspots with strong drying include western North America, Central America, Europe and the Mediterranean, the Amazon, southern Africa, China, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Compared to SSP3‐7.0 and SSP5‐8.5, however, the severity of drying in the lower warming scenarios is substantially reduced and further precipitation declines in many regions are avoided. Along with drying in the mean state, the risk of the historically most extreme drought events also increases with warming, by 200–300% in some regions. Soil moisture and runoff drying in CMIP6 is more robust, spatially extensive, and severe than precipitation, indicating an important role for other temperature‐sensitive drought processes, including evapotranspiration and snow. Given the similarity in drought responses between CMIP5 and CMIP6, we speculate that both generations of models are subject to similar uncertainties, including vegetation processes, model representations of precipitation, and the degree to which model responses to warming are consistent with observations. These topics should be further explored to evaluate whether CMIP6 models offer reasons to have increased confidence in drought projections."

The results reveal close similarity between both ensembles in the regional climate sensitivity of the projected multimodel mean changes in climate extremes, that is, their projected changes as a function of global warming. This stands in contrast to widely reported divergences in global (transient and equilibrium) climate sensitivity in the two multimodel ensembles. Some exceptions include higher warming in the South America monsoon region, lower warming in Southern Asia and Central Africa, and higher increases in heavy precipitation in Western Africa and the Sahel region in the CMIP6 ensemble. The multimodel spread in regional climate sensitivity is found to be large in both ensembles. In particular, it contributes more to intermodel spread in projected regional climate extremes compared with the intermodel spread in global climate sensitivity in CMIP6. Our results highlight the need to consider regional climate sensitivity as a distinct feature of Earth system models and a key determinant of projected regional impacts, which is largely independent of the models' response in global climate sensitivity."

We analyze the three archival Chandra X‐ray observations of Uranus (each 24–30 ks duration) to date: a stand‐alone Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observation on August 7, 2002 and two High Resolution Camera (HRC) observations on November 11 and 12, 2017 coordinated with optical observations. For the earlier ACIS observation, the Uranus‐coincident photons were clustered in the 0.6–1.1 keV spectral range, consistent with emission from Jupiter and Saturn. To test the significance of the detected signal, we distributed a grid of ∼10,000 Uranus‐sized regions across the field of view (FoV). The number of Uranus‐coincident X‐ray photons in the 0.5–1.2 keV range exceeded 99.9% of Uranus‐sized regions across the FoV (10.2 standard deviations &gt; FoV mean; probability of chance occurrence ∼10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>−7</jats:sup>). However, the planetary signal was low with only 5 ± 2.2 X‐ray photons against a FoV mean background of 0.16 photons. Without the possibility of energy filtering, the recent HRC observations had a much brighter background (FoV mean ∼10 photons). Consequently, neither of the new observations provided a second unambiguous Uranus detection, although a 40‐min interval of brightening on November 12, 2017 did produce a signal above 99.9% of the FoV. The observed Uranus X‐ray fluxes of 10<jats:sup>−15</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>−16</jats:sup> erg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/s are consistent with previous observational limits and modeling predictions. These fluxes exceed expectations from scattered solar emission alone, suggesting either a larger X‐ray albedo than Jupiter/Saturn or the possibility of additional X‐ray production processes at Uranus. Further observations are needed to test this."

A sensor head on the end of an optical fiber bundle that carried the laser beam and returned the scattered radiation could be placed against surfaces at any desired angle by a deployment mechanism; otherwise, the instrument would need no moving parts.

From frequencies of olivine peaks, we derived sufficiently precise forsterite contents to correlate the analyzed grains to known rock types and we obtained appropriate forsterite contents from weak signals above background in soil fines and breccias. Peak positions of pyroxenes were sufficiently well determined to distinguish among orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic (pyroxenoid) structures; additional information can be obtained from pyroxene spectra, but requires further laboratory calibration. Plagioclase provided sharp peaks in soil fines and most breccias even when the glass content was high."

The proportion of each mineral in the rock or soil can then be determined from the fraction of the spectra that contain its peaks, in analogy with the standard petrographic technique of point counting. The method can also be used for nondestructive laboratory characterization of rock samples. Although Raman peaks for different minerals seldom overlap each other, it is impractical to obtain proportions of constituent minerals by Raman spectroscopy through analysis of peak intensities in a spectrum obtained by broad‐beam sensing of a representative area of the target material. That is because the Raman signal strength produced by a mineral in a rock or soil is not related in a simple way through the Raman scattering cross section of that mineral to its proportion in the rock, and the signal‐to‐noise ratio of a Raman spectrum is poor when a sample is stimulated by a low‐power laser beam of broad diameter. Results obtained by the Raman point‐count method are demonstrated for a lunar thin section (14161,7062) and a rock fragment (15273,7039). Major minerals (plagioclase and pyroxene), minor minerals (cristobalite and K‐feldspar), and accessory minerals (whitlockite, apatite, and baddeleyite) were easily identified.

They can form water‐soluble complexes with lipophilic drugs, which ‘hide’ in the cavity. Cyclodextrins can be used to form aqueous eye drop solutions with lipophilic drugs, such as steroids and some carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The cyclodextrins increase the water solubility of the drug, enhance drug absorption into the eye, improve aqueous stability and reduce local irritation.Cyclodextrins are useful excipients in eye drop formulations of various drugs, including steroids of any kind, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, pilocarpine, cyclosporins, etc. Their use in ophthalmology has already begun and is likely to expand the selection of drugs available as eye drops.In this paper we review the properties of cyclodextrins and their application in eye drop formulations, of which their use in the formulation of dexamethasone eye drops is an example. Cyclodextrins have been used to formulate eye drops containing corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, with levels of concentration and ocular absorption which, according to human and animal studies, are many times those seen with presently available formulations. Cyclodextrin‐based dexamethasone eye drops are well tolerated in the eye and seem to provide a higher degree of bioavailability and clinical efficiency than the steroid eye drop formulations presently available. Such formulations offer the possibility of once per day application of corticosteroid eye drops after eye surgery, and more intensive topical steroid treatment in severe inflammation.While cyclodextrins have been known for more than a century, their use in ophthalmology is just starting. Cyclodextrins are useful excipients in eye drop formulations for a variety of lipophilic drugs. They will facilitate eye drop formulations for drugs that otherwise might not be available for topical use, while improving absorption and stability and decreasing local irritation."

Ten minutes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion (CAO) combined with hemorrhage-induced hypotension (around 30 mm Hg) significantly decreased cerebral blood flow and microcirculation in male Wistar rats subjected to streptozotocin-induced diabetes.

PEx-4 was more effective than Ex-4 to improve CAO-induced oxidative injury and cognitive deficits. The neuroprotection provided by PEx-4 was through p-Akt/p-eNOS pathways, which suppressed CAO-enhanced NF- κB/ICAM-1 signaling, ER stress, and apoptosis. "

The stimulated DLPFC–NAcc FC strength negatively correlated with improved depressive and anxious symptoms. This study is the first to demonstrate that the resting-state FC of the stimulated DLPFC–NAcc, rather than regional brain activity or local synchronization in the stimulated target, might predict the anti-depression and anti-anxiety effects of rTMS for depression."

Changes in cortical excitability and short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) were assessed via motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) before and up to 60 mins following stimulation. iTBS-15-iTBS increased MEP amplitude for up to 60 mins post stimulation, whereas iTBS-5-iTBS decreased MEP amplitude. In contrast, MEP amplitude was not altered by single iTBS. Despite the group level findings, only 53% of individuals showed facilitated MEPs following iTBS-15-iTBS, and only 40% inhibited MEPs following iTBS-5-iTBS. Modulation of SICI did not differ between conditions. These results suggest interval duration between spaced iTBS plays an important role in determining the direction of plasticity on excitatory, but not inhibitory circuits in human motor cortex. While repeated iTBS can increase the magnitude of MEP facilitation/inhibition in some individuals compared to single iTBS, the response to repeated iTBS appears variable between individuals in this small sample."

Monitoring temperature with higher precision at localized small length scales or in a nanocavity is a necessity in various applications. As well as the detection of biologically interesting metal ions using low-cost and sensitive approach is of great importance in bioanalysis. In this paper, we describe the preparation of dual-function highly fluorescent B, N-co-doped carbon nanodots (CDs) that work as chemical and thermal sensors. The CDs emit blue fluorescence peaked at 450 nm and exhibit up to 70% photoluminescence quantum yield with showing excitation-independent fluorescence. We also show that water-soluble CDs display temperature-dependent fluorescence and can serve as highly sensitive and reliable nanothermometers with a thermo-sensitivity 1.8% °C<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and wide range thermo-sensing between 0–90 °C with excellent recovery.

In recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (LULC) changes in the Dongting Lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. Its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Therefore, we retrieved the Land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the LULC types. The results showed that LST is significantly affected by surface type. LST varied significantly across LULC types, with higher LSTs in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. Water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing LST and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. The winter LST in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 °C, which may be related to the decrease in the area of Dongting Lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the Three Gorges Reservoir was impounded. Compared with the relationship between the NDVI, DEM, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the NDMI and LST was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on LST. These insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of LST."

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) improves drop foot gait although the mechanistic basis for this effect is not well understood. To answer this question, we evaluated the gait of a post-stroke patient walking with and without FES by inverse dynamics analysis and compared the results to an optimal control framework. The effect of FES and cause-effect relationship of changes in knee and ankle muscle strength were investigated; personalized muscle–tendon parameters allowed the prediction of pathologic gait. We also predicted healthy gait patterns at different speeds to simulate the subject walking without impairment. The passive moment of the knee played an important role in the estimation of muscle force with knee hyperextension, which was decreased during FES and knee extensor strengthening. Weakening the knee extensors and strengthening the flexors improved SKG. During FES, weak ankle plantarflexors and strong ankle dorsiflexors resulted in increased ankle dorsiflexion, which reduced drop foot. FES also improved gait speed and reduced circumduction. These findings provide insight into compensatory strategies adopted by post-stroke patients that can guide the design of individualized rehabilitation and treatment programs."

We here investigate the interaction dynamics of two initially superimposed fundamental solitons at distinctly different frequencies. Both pulses are located in distinct domains of anomalous dispersion, separated by an interjacent domain of normal dispersion, so that group velocity matching can be achieved despite a vast frequency gap. We demonstrate the existence of two regions with different dynamical behavior. For small velocity mismatch we observe a domain in which a single heteronuclear pulse compound is formed, which is distinct from the usual concept of soliton molecules. The binding mechanism is realized by the mutual cross phase modulation of the interacting pulses. For large velocity mismatch both pulses escape their mutual binding and move away from each other. The crossover phase between these two cases exhibits two localized states with different velocity, consisting of a strong trapping pulse and weak trapped pulse. We detail a simplified theoretical approach which accurately estimates the parameter range in which compound states are formed. This trapping-to-escape transition allows to study the limits of pulse-bonding as a fundamental phenomenon in nonlinear optics, opening up new perspectives for the all-optical manipulation of light by light."

4276,4276,10.1038/srep08603,research problem,A Graphene-Based Resistive Pressure Sensor with Record-High Sensitivity in a Wide Pressure Range,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R138210,Engineering,"Pressure sensors are a key component in electronic skin (e-skin) sensing systems. Most reported resistive pressure sensors have a high sensitivity at low pressures (&lt;5 kPa) to enable ultra-sensitive detection. However, the sensitivity drops significantly at high pressures (&gt;5 kPa), which is inadequate for practical applications. For example, actions like a gentle touch and object manipulation have pressures below 10 kPa and 10–100 kPa, respectively. Maintaining a high sensitivity in a wide pressure range is in great demand. Here, a flexible, wide range and ultra-sensitive resistive pressure sensor with a foam-like structure based on laser-scribed graphene (LSG) is demonstrated. Benefitting from the large spacing between graphene layers and the unique v-shaped microstructure of the LSG, the sensitivity of the pressure sensor is as high as 0.96 kPa<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in a wide pressure range (0 ~ 50 kPa). Considering both sensitivity and pressure sensing range, the pressure sensor developed in this work is the best among all reported pressure sensors to date. A model of the LSG pressure sensor is also established, which agrees well with the experimental results. This work indicates that laser scribed flexible graphene pressure sensors could be widely used for artificial e-skin, medical-sensing, bio-sensing and many other areas."

The CVD graphene layer is transferred onto a poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) film to provide a mechanical stability and flexibility. The surface of the CVD graphene is functionalized with diaminonaphthalene (DAN) to form flower shapes. Palladium nanoparticles act as templates to mediate the formation of FPNCs, which increase in size with reaction time. The population of FPNCs can be controlled by adjusting the DAN concentration as functionalization solution. These FPNCs_CG electrodes are sensitive to hydrogen gas at room temperature. The sensitivity and response time as a function of the FPNCs population are investigated, resulted in improved performance with increasing population. Furthermore, the minimum detectable level (MDL) of hydrogen is 0.1 ppm, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of chemical sensors based on other Pd-based hybrid materials."

Despite its wide-ranging implications for biology and conservation, the answer remains open to debate. Butterflies constitute the best-studied invertebrates, playing a similar role as birds do in providing models for vertebrate biology. An accurate assessment of cryptic diversity in this emblematic group requires meticulous case-by-case assessments, but a preview to highlight cases of particular interest will help to direct future studies. We present a survey of mitochondrial genetic diversity for the butterfly fauna of the Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution (3502 DNA barcodes for all 228 species), creating a reliable system for DNA-based identification and for the detection of overlooked diversity. After compiling available data for European butterflies (5782 sequences, 299 species), we applied the Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent model to explore potential cryptic diversity at a continental scale. The results indicate that 27.7% of these species include from two to four evolutionary significant units (ESUs), suggesting that cryptic biodiversity may be higher than expected for one of the best-studied invertebrate groups and regions. The ESUs represent important units for conservation, models for studies of evolutionary and speciation processes and sentinels for future research to unveil hidden diversity."

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) above the auditory cortex has been reported to improve auditory processing and to reduce the perception of tinnitus, which results from network dysfunction involving both auditory and non-auditory brain regions. SSHL patients who were refractory to standard corticosteroid therapy (SCT) and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy received 20 sessions of 1 Hz rTMS to the temporoparietal junction ipsilateral to the symptomatic ear (rTMS group). RTMS therapy administered in addition to SCT and HBO therapy resulted in significantly greater recovery of hearing function and improvement of tinnitus perception compared SCT and HBO therapy without rTMS therapy. Additionally, the single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurements obtained in a subgroup of patients suggested that the rTMS therapy could have alleviated the decrease in regional cerebral brain flow (rCBF) in SSHL patients. RTMS appears to be an effective, practical and safe treatment strategy for SSHL."

Here we report a study of an AGE outbreak in an elementary school in December 2014 caused by the new GII.17 NoV to explore the potential mechanism behind the sudden epidemics of the GII.17 NoV. A total of 276 individuals were sick with typical NoV infection symptoms of vomiting (93.4%), abdominal pain (90.4%), nausea (60.0%) and diarrhea (10.4%) at an attack rate of 5.7–16.9%. Genotyping of the symptomatic patients showed that individuals with a secretor positive status, including those with A, B and O secretors and Lewis positive blood types, were sensitive to the virus, while the non-secretors and the Lewis negative individual were not. Accordingly, the recombinant capsid P protein of the GII.17 isolate showed a wide binding spectrum to saliva samples of all A, B and O secretors. Thus, the broad binding spectrum of the new GII.17 variant could explain its widely spread nature in China and surrounding areas in the past two years."

However, the considerable variability in reported neuroimaging results mirrors the heterogeneity of the disorder. Machine learning methods capable of representing invariant features could circumvent this problem. In this structural MRI study, we trained a deep learning model known as deep belief network (DBN) to extract features from brain morphometry data and investigated its performance in discriminating between healthy controls (N = 83) and patients with schizophrenia (N = 143). We further analysed performance in classifying patients with a first-episode psychosis (N = 32). The DBN highlighted differences between classes, especially in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular cortices, and in some subcortical regions, including the corpus callosum, putamen, and cerebellum. The DBN was slightly more accurate as a classifier (accuracy = 73.6%) than the support vector machine (accuracy = 68.1%). Finally, the error rate of the DBN in classifying first-episode patients was 56.3%, indicating that the representations learned from patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were not suitable to define these patients. Our data suggest that deep learning could improve our understanding of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia by improving neuromorphometric analyses."

Natural language processing of electronic health records is increasingly used to study mental health conditions and risk behaviours on a large scale. However, narrative notes written by clinicians do not capture first-hand the patients’ own experiences, and only record cross-sectional, professional impressions at the point of care. Social media platforms have become a source of ‘in the moment’ daily exchange, with topics including well-being and mental health. In this study, we analysed posts from the social media platform Reddit and developed classifiers to recognise and classify posts related to mental illness according to 11 disorder themes. Using a neural network and deep learning approach, we could automatically recognise mental illness-related posts in our balenced dataset with an accuracy of 91.08% and select the correct theme with a weighted average accuracy of 71.37%.

We hypothesized that low-frequency stimulation of the OFC would lead to a reduction in clinical symptoms, as measured on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). A randomized, double-blind, crossover design was implemented with two 1-week treatment periods (active stimulation versus sham stimulation) separated by a 1-month washout period. Concomitantly, a subgroup of patients underwent a positron emission tomography (PET) scan after each stimulation sequence. Statistical analyses compared the Y-BOCS scores at the end of each period. At day 7, we observed a significant decrease from baseline in the Y-BOCS scores, after both active (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.01) and sham stimulation (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.02). This decrease tended to be larger after active stimulation than after sham stimulation: −6 (−29, 0) points versus −2 (−20, 4) points (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.07). Active versus sham PET scan contrasts showed that stimulation was related to a bilateral decrease in the metabolism of the OFC. The OFC should definitely be regarded as a key neuroanatomical target for rTMS, as it is easier to reach than either the striatum or the subthalamic nucleus, structures favored in neurosurgical approaches."

Novices and experts alike rely on conceptual models to build their own personal mental models for predicting and explaining molecular processes. There is evidence that chemistry students lack rich mental models of the molecular level; their mental models of reaction mechanisms have often been described as static and not process-oriented. Our goal in this study was to characterize the various mental models students may have when learning a new reaction mechanism and to explore how they use them in different situations. We explored the characteristics of first year organic chemistry students’ (<italic>N</italic> = 7) mental models of epoxide-opening reaction mechanisms by qualitative analysis of transcripts and written answers following an audio-recorded interview discussion. We discovered that individual learners relied on a combination of both static (with a focus on symbolism and patterns) and dynamic (reactivity as process or as particles in motion) working mental models, and that different working mental models were used depending on the task. Static working mental models were typically used to reason generally about the reaction mechanism and products that the participants provided. Dynamic working mental models were commonly used when participants were prompted to describe how they pictured the reaction happening, and in attempting to describe the structure of a transition state. Implications for research, teaching, and learning from these findings are described herein.</p>"

N174,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R26394,Science,"Chitosanase was produced by the strain of Streptomyces lividans TK24 bearing the csn gene from Streptomyces sp. N174, and purified by S-Sepharose and Bio-Gel A column chromatography. Partially (25-35%) N-acetylated chitosan was digested by the purified chitosanase, and structures of the products were analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The chitosanase produced heterooligosaccharides consisting of D-GlcN and GlcNAc in addition to glucosamine oligosaccharides [(GlcN)n, n = 1, 2 and 3]. The reducing- and non-reducing-end residues of the heterooligosaccharide products were GlcNAc and GlcN respectively, indicating that the chitosanase can split the GlcNAc-GlcN linkage in addition to that of GlcN-GlcN. Time-dependent 1H-NMR spectra showing hydrolysis of (GlcN)6 by the chitosanase were obtained in order to determine the anomeric form of the reaction products. The chitosanase was found to produce only the alpha-form; therefore it is an inverting enzyme. Separation and quantification of (GlcN)n was achieved by HPLC, and the time course of the reaction catalysed by the chitosanase was studied using (GlcN)n (n = 4, 5 and 6) as the substrate. The chitosanase hydrolysed (GlcN)6 in an endo-splitting manner producing (GlcN)2, (GlcN)3 and (GlcN)4, and did not catalyse transglycosylation. Product distribution was (GlcN)3 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (GlcN)2 &amp;gt; (GlcN)4. Cleavage to (GlcN)3 + (GlcN)3 predominated over that to (GlcN)2 + (GlcN)4. Time courses showed a decrease in rate of substrate degradation from (GlcN)6 to (GlcN)5 to (GlcN)4. It is most likely that the substrate-binding cleft of the chitosanase can accommodate at least six GlcN residues, and that the cleavage point is located at the midpoint of the binding cleft."

However, surveillance data use can be frustrated by the infrequent nature of many infections. Traditional methods of analysis often provide delayed identification of increasing infection occurrence, placing patients at preventable risk. The application of Shewhart, Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) statistical process control charts to the monitoring of indicator infections allows continuous real‐time assessment. The Shewhart chart will detect large changes, while CUSUM and EWMA methods are more suited to recognition of small to moderate sustained change. When used together, Shewhart and EWMA methods are ideal for monitoring bacteraemia and multiresistant organism rates. Shewhart and CUSUM charts are suitable for surgical infection surveillance."

Here, we tested the hypothesis that rTMS at individual upper alpha frequency (IAF + 1 Hz) can enhance alpha power in the reference interval, and can thus improve task performance. Repetitive TMS was delivered to the mesial frontal (Fz) and right parietal (P6) cortex, and as sham condition with 90°‐tilted coil (P6 position). The behavioural effect was assessed in a mental rotation task. Further control conditions were rTMS at a lower IAF (IAF − 3 Hz) and at 20 Hz.

However, eggshell thickness was more strongly linked to egg size (mass) than to measured levels of p,p′DDE (the primary metabolite of DDT). Egg size was consistent within individual females and yielded correlation coefficients with shell thickness ranging from 0.49 to 0.97, depending on the period and the analysis assumptions used. Measured DDE levels, although often substantial, provided only a weak correlation (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = −0.33) with shell thickness. In part, the absence of a strong DDE/thickness correlation may have been an artefact of losses of DDE from fragment membranes over time. Nevertheless, the extreme (28–29%) shell thinning of the 1960s was not linked with clearly increased egg‐breakage or nest‐failure rates, and one female of the 1980s with 25.6% shell thinning was the most productive female of her era. Some eggs with over 30% shell thinning hatched successfully, and broken eggs closely resembled hatched eggs in shell thickness, strongly suggesting that shell thinning was not an important cause of breakage. The apparent absence of harmful effects from the extreme shell thinning of the 1960s may have resulted from (1) the fact that historic pre‐DDT condor eggs were on average 16.7% thicker shelled for their mass than predicted by the overall egg mass/shell thickness curve for birds, and (2) a possible egg‐size decline or sampling bias toward small‐egged females in the 1960s.

Linear models were used to predict the effects of environment and disturbance on the richness of each of these groups. Total native species and rare native species showed similar responses, with richness declining on sites of increasing natural fertility of parent material as well as declining under conditions of water enrichment (resulting from human‐induced changes in drainage characteristics, leading to increased run‐off), severe livestock grazing, and soil disturbance. The response of rare native species to water enrichment, however, was significantly greater than that of all native species. Exotic species richness varied in reverse to that of native species with positive responses to water enrichment and soil disturbance. The contrasting behaviors are attributed to differences in the evolutionary history of native and exotic assemblages and their resulting preadaptations to a landscape recently subjected to agricultural settlement. It would appear that for exogenous disturbances, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is not supported by our data. In the sampled region, pastures represent the major land‐use in terms of area, but have relatively low densities of native and rare species compared with more lightly grazed areas.

The cover of five common exotic forb species tended to be lower in verges along four‐wheel‐drive tracks than in verges along more improved roads. The richness and cover of exotic species were both more than 50% greater, and the richness of native species was 30% lower, at interior sites adjacent to paved roads than at those adjacent to four‐wheel‐drive tracks. In addition, environmental variables relating to dominant vegetation, disturbance, and topography were significantly correlated with exotic and native species richness and cover. Improved roads can act as conduits for the invasion of adjacent ecosystems by converting natural habitats to those highly vulnerable to invasion. However, variation in dominant vegetation, soil moisture, nutrient levels, soil depth, disturbance, and topography may render interior communities differentially susceptible to invasions originating from roadside verges. Plant communities that are both physically invasible ( e.g., characterized by deep or fertile soils ) and disturbed appear most vulnerable.

Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties.
<jats:italic>Aims</jats:italic>. With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new <jats:italic>XMM-Newton</jats:italic> observations of this cluster during the observations of <jats:italic>Kepler</jats:italic> K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages.
<jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and <jats:italic>XMM-Newton</jats:italic> light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis.
<jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500 s during one of the flares.
<jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as “superflares” based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary."

Stars are strong emitters at X-ray and UV wavelengths in their first billion of years and this strongly affects the evaporation, thermodynamics, and chemistry in the atmospheres of the young planets orbiting around them. In order to investigate these effects in young exoplanets, we observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with <jats:italic>XMM-Newton</jats:italic>. We recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration, from the rise to the end of the decay, was about 8 − 10 ks in soft X-rays (0.3–10 keV). The flares were also recorded in the 200–300 nm band with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase, followed by evaporation and an increase in the density and emission of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54–55 MK. Diagnostics based on the temperatures and timescales of the flares applied to these two events have allowed us to infer a loop length of 5 − 7 × 10<jats:sup>10</jats:sup> cm, which is about the extent of the stellar radius. We also inferred the values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3 − 6.5 × 10<jats:sup>11</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>, along with a minimum magnetic field strength on the order of 300–500 G that is needed to confine the plasma.

We speculate that the flares were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 h after the flares, which dramatically increased the rate of evaporation for the planet. From the RGS spectra, we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and flaring states, respectively. Finally, we inferred a high electron density measurement, which is in agreement with the inferences drawn from time-resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, as well as the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares."

Its use is aimed at creating a single information space that allows to unite all the components of production, starting from the processed raw materials to the interaction with suppliers and users of completed goods. Such a union will allow to change the established business processes of production to increase the customization of end products for the consumer and to reduce the costs for its producers. Each of the components is described using a digital twin, showing their main characteristics, important for production. The heterogeneity of these characteristics for each of the production levels makes it very difficult to exchange information between them. To solve the problem of interaction between individual components this paper proposes to use the ontological approach to model the components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems. The paper considers four scenarios of interaction in the industrial Internet of things, based on which the upper-level ontology is formed, which describes the main components of industrial socio-cyberphysical systems and the connections between them."

Here, by comparing DRs with educated working controls, we show that DRs report significantly greater anxiety and depression, and that this difference is not explained by a higher rate of pre-existing mental health problems. Moreover, most DRs perceive poor mental health as a ‘normal’ part of the PhD process. Thus, our findings suggest a hazardous impact of PhD study on mental health, with DRs being particularly at risk of developing common mental health problems. This provides an evidence-based mandate for universities and funders to reflect upon practices related to DR training and mental health.

Nevertheless, the interaction of UV photons with surface is not clearly understood because of the difficulty in monitoring photons during plasma processing. For this purpose, we have previously proposed an on-wafer monitoring technique for UV photons. For this study, using the combination of this on-wafer monitoring technique and a neural network, we established a relationship between the data obtained from the on-wafer monitoring technique and UV spectra. Also, we obtained absolute intensities of UV radiation by calibrating arbitrary units of UV intensity with a 126 nm excimer lamp. As a result, UV spectra and their absolute intensities could be predicted with the on-wafer monitoring. Furthermore, we developed a prediction system with the on-wafer monitoring technique to simulate UV-radiation damage in dielectric films during plasma etching. UV-induced damage in SiOC films was predicted in this study. Our prediction results of damage in SiOC films shows that UV spectra and their absolute intensities are the key cause of damage in SiOC films. In addition, UV-radiation damage in SiOC films strongly depends on the geometry of the etching structure.

These experiments use 0.17 mg of fuel with the potential for ignition and significant fusion yield conditions. The thermonuclear fuel has been fielded as a cryogenic layer on the inside of a spherical plastic capsule that is mounted in the center of a cylindrical gold hohlraum. Heating the hohlraum with 192 laser beams for a total laser energy of 1.6 MJ produces a soft x-ray field with 300 eV temperature. The ablation pressure produced by the radiation field compresses the initially 2.2-mm diameter capsule by a factor of 30 to a spherical dense fuel shell that surrounds a central hot-spot plasma of 50 μm diameter. While an extensive set of x-ray and neutron diagnostics has been applied to characterize hot spot formation from the x-ray emission and 14.1 MeV deuterium-tritium primary fusion neutrons, thermonuclear fuel assembly is studied by measuring the down-scattered neutrons with energies in the range of 10 to 12 MeV. X-ray and neutron imaging of the compressed core and fuel indicate a fuel thickness of (14 ± 3) μm, which combined with magnetic recoil spectrometer measurements of the fuel areal density of (1 ± 0.09) g cm–2 result in fuel densities approaching 600 g cm–3. The fuel surrounds a hot-spot plasma with average ion temperatures of (3.5 ± 0.1) keV that is measured with neutron time of flight spectra. The hot-spot plasma produces a total fusion neutron yield of 1015 that is measured with the magnetic recoil spectrometer and nuclear activation diagnostics that indicate a 14.1 MeV yield of (7.5±0.1)×1014 which is 70% to 75% of the total fusion yield due to the high areal density. Gamma ray measurements provide the duration of nuclear activity of (170 ± 30) ps. These indirect-drive implosions result in the highest areal densities and neutron yields achieved on laser facilities to date. This achievement is the result of the first hohlraum and capsule tuning experiments where the stagnation pressures have been systematically increased by more than a factor of 10 by fielding low-entropy implosions through the control of radiation symmetry, small hot electron production, and proper shock timing. The stagnation pressure is above 100 Gbars resulting in high Lawson-type confinement parameters of Pτ≃10 atm s. Comparisons with radiation-hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the pressure is within a factor of three required for reaching ignition and high yield. This will be the focus of future higher-velocity implosions that will employ additional optimizations of hohlraum, capsule and laser pulse shape conditions."

Although a direct-current power supply is used, the discharge shows a pulsed characteristic. Based on the voltage-current curve and fast photography, the brush-shaped plume, like the gliding arc plasma, is in fact a temporal superposition of a moving discharge filament in an arched shape. During it moves away from the nozzle, the discharge evolves from a low-current arc into a normal glow in one discharge cycle. The emission profile is explained qualitatively based on the dynamics of the plasma brush."

A high open-circuit voltage of 1.0 V reported experimentally was successfully reproduced in the simulation, and also other solar cell parameters well consistent with real devices were obtained. In addition, the effect of carrier diffusion length of the absorber and interface defect densities at front and back sides and the optimum thickness of the absorber were analyzed. The results revealed that the diffusion length experimentally reported is long enough for high efficiency, and the defect density at the front interface is critical for high efficiency. Also, the optimum absorber thickness well consistent with the thickness range of real devices was derived."

As moderate stable reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was studied. Highly reactive oxygen radicals, namely, superoxide anion (O2•−) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), were investigated by the use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. All species amounts were detected for three different treatment cases: Plasma jet generated VUV and UV radiation, plasma jet generated UV radiation without VUV part, and complete plasma jet including all reactive components additionally to VUV and UV radiation. It was found that a considerable amount of radicals are generated by the plasma generated photoemission.

The as-synthesized nanowires show two different PL peaks positioned at 380 nm and 520 nm. The 380 nm emission is ascribed to near band edge emission, and the green peak (520 nm) appears due to the oxygen vacancy defects. The intensity of the green PL signal enhances upon hydrogen gas exposure, whereas it gets quenched upon oxygen gas loading. The ZnO nanowires' sensing response values were observed as about 54% for H2 gas and 9% for O2 gas at room temperature for 50 sccm H2/O2 gas flow rate. The sensor response was also analyzed as a function of sample temperature ranging from 300 K to 400 K. A conclusion was derived from the observations that the H2/O2 gases affect the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of ZnO nanowires. The adsorbed species result in the band bending and hence changes the depletion region which causes variation in PL signal. A photoluminescence based gas sensing technique has advantage over a conductometric technique due to its higher sensitivity and faster response time."

An improved crystal quality with respect to the increased film thickness was observed; where full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the AlN films decreased from 2.88 ± 0.16° down to 1.25 ± 0.07° and the effective longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d33,f) increased from 2.30 ± 0.32 pm/V up to 5.57 ± 0.34 pm/V for film thicknesses in the range of 30 nm to 2 μm.

This paper reviews some of the recent work carried out at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Laser action has been demonstrated at wavelengths as short as 35.6 Å while saturation of the small signal gain has been observed with longer wavelength schemes. Some of the most successful schemes to date have been collisionally pumped x-ray lasers that use the thermal electron distribution within a laser-produced plasma to excite electrons from closed shells in neon- and nickel-like ions to metastable levels in the next shell. Attempts to quantify and improve the longitudinal and transverse coherence of collisionally pumped x-ray lasers are motivated by the desire to produce sources for specific applications. Toward this goal there is a large effort underway to enhance the power output of the Ni-like Ta x-ray laser at 44.83 Å as a source for x-ray imaging of live cells. Improving the efficiency of x-ray lasers in order to produce saturated output with smaller pump lasers is also a goal of this work.

Refraction, due to electron density gradients, tends to direct the x-rays out of high density regions. This can have the undesirable effect of shortening the distance that the x ray stay within the plasma, thereby limiting the amount of amplification. The exploding foil design lessens refraction, but does not eliminate it. In this paper, a quantitative analysis of propagation and amplification in an exploding foil x-ray laser is presented. The density and gain profiles within the plasma are modeled in an approximate manner, which enables considerable analytic progress. It is found that refraction introduces a loss term to the laser amplification. The beam pattern from a parabolic gain profile laser has a dominant peak on the x-ray laser axis. The pattern from a quartic gain profile having a dip on-axis can produce a profile with off-axis peaks, in better agreement with recent experimental data."

In this contribution, we report on absolute optical emission and absorption spectroscopy of a radio frequency (RF) driven capacitively coupled argon glow discharge operated in a parallel-plate configuration. This enabled the study of all key parameters including electron density and temperature, gas temperature, and absolute densities of atoms in highly electronically excited states. Space and time-averaged electron density and temperature were determined from the measurement of the absolute intensity of the electron-atom bremsstrahlung in the visible range. Considering the non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function, an electron temperature (Te) of 2.1 eV and an electron density (ne) of 1.1×1019m−3 were obtained. The time-averaged and spatially resolved absolute densities of atoms in the metastable (1s5 and 1s3) and resonant (1s4 and 1s2) states of argon in the pure Ar and Ar/He mixture were obtained by broadband absorption spectroscopy. The 1s5 metastable atoms had the largest density near the sheath region with a maximum value of 8×1017m−3, while all other 1s states had densities of at most 2×1017m−3.

Invasive plant species may benefit from a reduction in herbivory in their introduced range. The reduced herbivory may cause a reallocation of resources from defence to fitness. Here, we evaluated leaf herbivory of an invasive tree species (Ligustrum lucidum Aiton) in its native and novel ranges, and determined the potential changes in leaf traits that may be associated with the patterns of herbivory. We measured forest structure, damage by herbivores and leaf traits in novel and native ranges, and on the basis of the literature, we identified the common natural herbivores of L. lucidum. We also performed an experiment offering leaves from both ranges to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera frugiperda). L. lucidum was more abundant and experienced significantly less foliar damage in the novel than in the native range, in spite of the occurrence of several natural herbivores. The reduced lignin content and lower lignin : N ratio in novel leaves, together with the higher herbivore preference for leaves of this origin in the laboratory experiment, indicated lower herbivore resistance in novel than in native populations. The reduced damage by herbivores is not the only factor explaining invasion success, but it may be an important cause that enhances the invasiveness of L. lucidum.

wheat-sheep belt of south-eastern Australia. Tree clearing, cultivation and pasture improvement have led
to fragmentation of this once relatively continuous ecosystem, leaving a series of remnants which
themselves have been modified by livestock grazing. Little-modified remnants are extremely rare. We
examined and compared the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on the understorey flora of
woodland remnants, through a survey of remnants of varying size, grazing history and tree clearing. In
accordance with fragmentation theory, species richness generally increased with remnant size, and, for
little-grazed remnants, smaller remnants were more vulnerable to weed invasion. Similarly, tree
clearing and grazing encouraged weed invasion and reduced native species richness. Evidence for
increased total species richness at intermediate grazing levels, as predicted by the intermediate
disturbance hypothesis, was equivocal. Remnant quality was more severely affected by grazing than by
remnant size. All little-grazed remnants had lower exotic species abundance and similar or higher native
species richness than grazed remnants, despite their extremely small sizes (&lt; 6 ha). Further, small, littlegrazed
remnants maintained the general character of the pre-European woodland understorey, while
grazing caused changes to the dominant species. Although generally small, the little-grazed remnants
are the best representatives of the pre-European woodland understorey, and should be central to any
conservation plan for the woodlands. Selected larger remnants are needed to complement these,
however, to increase the total area of woodland conserved, and, because most little-grazed remnants are
cleared, to represent the ecosystem in its original structural form. For the maintenance of native plant
diversity and composition in little-grazed remnants, it is critical that livestock grazing continues to be
excluded. For grazed remnants, maintenance of a site in its current state would allow continuation of
past management, while restoration to a pre-European condition would require management directed
towards weed removal, and could take advantage of the difference noted in the predominant life-cycle
of native (perennial) versus exotic (annual or biennial) species. "

Holcus lanatus L. can colonise a wide range of sites within the naturalised grassland of the Humid Dominion of Chile. The objectives were to determine plant growth mechanisms and strategies that have allowed H. lanatus to colonise contrasting pastures and to determine the existence of ecotypes of H. lanatus in southern Chile. Plants of H. lanatus were collected from four geographic zones of southern Chile and established in a randomised complete block design with four replicates. Five newly emerging tillers were marked per plant and evaluated at the vegetative, pre-ear emergence, complete emerged inflorescence, end of flowering period, and mature seed stages. At each evaluation, one marked tiller was harvested per plant. The variables measured included lamina length and width, tiller height, length of the inflorescence, total number of leaves, and leaf, stem, and inflorescence mass. At each phenological stage, groups of accessions were statistically formed using cluster analysis. The grouping of accessions (cluster analysis) into statistically different groups (ANOVA and canonical variate analysis) indicated the existence of different ecotypes. The phenotypic variation within each group of the accessions suggested that each group has its own phenotypic plasticity. It is concluded that the successful colonisation by H. lanatus has resulted from diversity within the species.

The seedlings’ ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with 15N-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species."

Two geographically distinct populations of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum L. were compared after acclimation to five different nitrogen concentrations (0.005, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mM N) in a common garden setup. The two populations were an apparent invasive population from New Zealand (NZ) and a noninvasive population from Denmark (DK). The populations were compared with a focus on both morphological and physiological traits. The NZ population had higher relative growth rates (RGRs) and photosynthesis rates (Pmax) (range: RGR, 0.06–0.08 per day; Pmax, 200–395 µmol O2 g–1 dry mass (DM) h–1) compared with the Danish population (range: RGR, 0.02–0.05 per day; Pmax, 88–169 µmol O2 g–1 DM h–1). The larger, faster-growing NZ population also showed higher plasticity than the DK population in response to nitrogen in traits important for growth. Hence, the observed differences in growth behaviour between the two populations are a result of genetic differences and differences in their level of plasticity. Here, we show that two populations of the same species from similar climates but different geographical areas can differ in several ecophysiological traits after growth in a common garden setup.

A neighbour-joining tree was generated and nucleotide sequence divergences were calculated. All species except Sarcophaga (Fergusonimyia) bancroftorum, known for high morphological variability, were resolved as monophyletic (99.2% of cases), with bootstrap support of 100. Excluding S. bancroftorum, the mean intraspecific and interspecific variation ranged from 1.12% and 2.81–11.23%, respectively, allowing for species discrimination.

A dipstick, competitive immunoassay for rapidly measuring serum oestrone
sulfate (OS) concentrations in horses was developed to distinguish mares 100
or more days pregnant from non-pregnant animals. 6-Ketoestrone
6-carboxymethyloxime conjugated to bovine serum albumin (oestrone CMO-BSA) was
‘dotted’ 25 mm from the bottom edge of 45 5 mm strips of
polyester-film-supported cellulose nitrate membrane, pore size 3 m. The strips
were blocked, dried and a 15 5-mm cellulose absorbent sink attached 10 mm from
the top of each strip. The manufactured dipsticks were stored with desiccant
at room temperature until used. A monoclonal antibody recognizing OS was
coated onto uniform, blue-dyed polystyrene microspheres (mean diameter, 0.31
m) by adsorption. After blocking, several washes and resuspension by
sonication, the antibody-coated microspheres were stored at 4˚C. The
concentrations of oestrone CMO-BSA dotted onto the dipsticks and OS antibody
coated onto the microspheres were optimized to produce a test that allowed
maximum discrimination between the concentrations of OS found in serum of
mares 100 or more days pregnant (i.e. &gt;30 ng OS mL
–1 ) relative to those found in non-pregnant mares
(i.e. &lt;10 ng OS mL –1 ). To perform the
dipstick test, 30 L of carrier buffer, 10 L of OS antibody-coated microspheres
and 10 l of OS standard or serum sample were pipetted into a microwell and
mixed. A dipstick was placed in the solution. All the liquid migrated up the
dipstick into the absorbent sink within 15–20 min leaving a blue dot
where the OCMO-BSA had been placed. The intensity of colour of the blue dot,
which correlated inversely with the concentration of OS in the standard or
serum sample, was assessed visually and by computer image analysis. An OS
concentration less than 5 ng mL –1 produced a deep
blue dot, 20 ng/ml a light blue dot and a concentration greater than 50 ng
mL –1 a very faint blue dot, or none at all. Serum
samples from 42 non-pregnant mares and 40 mares over 100 days pregnant were
analysed by the dipstick test. All the serum samples from non-pregnant mares
produced dipsticks with deep blue dots that ranged in intensity from 20 to 38
colour intensity units, equivalent to OS concentrations less than 7 ng mL
–1 . Sera from all the pregnant mares generated
dipsticks with either faint blue dots or none at all (i.e. £=5
colour intensity units, equivalent to OS concentrations &gt;40 ng mL

dipstick immunoassay offers a practical, alternative means of analysing serum
OS concentrations in horses, and enables mares that are 100 or more days

The present study tested whether this process results in variable fractionation of the oxygen and carbon isotopes in shell calcium carbonate, which could provide a detailed insight into the temporal and spatial use of the eggshell by the developing embryo. Despite the uncertainty regarding changes in stable isotope composition of the eggshell across developmental stages or regions of the shell, eggshells are a popular resource for the analysis of historic and extant trophic relationships. To clarify how the stable isotope composition varies with embryonic development, the δ13C and δ18O content of the carbonate fraction in shells of black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus) eggs were sampled at four different stages of embryonic development and at five eggshell regions. No consistent relationship between the stable isotope composition of the eggshell and embryonic development, shell region or maculation was observed, although shell thickness decreased with development in all shell regions.

Overgrazing and climate warming may be important drivers of alpine rangeland degradation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, the effects of grazing and experimental warming on the vegetation of cultivated grasslands, alpine steppe and alpine meadows on the QTP were investigated. The three treatments were a control, a warming treatment and a grazing treatment and were replicated three times on each vegetation type. The warming treatment was applied using fibreglass open-top chambers and the grazing treatment was continuous grazing by yaks at a moderately high stocking rate. Both grazing and warming negatively affected vegetation cover. Grazing reduced vegetation height while warming increased vegetation height. Grazing increased but warming reduced plant diversity. Grazing decreased and warming increased the aboveground plant biomass. Grazing increased the preferred forage species in native rangelands (alpine steppe and alpine meadow), while warming increased the preferred forage species in the cultivated grassland. Grazing reduced the vegetation living state (VLS) of all three alpine grasslands by nearly 70%, while warming reduced the VLS of the cultivated grassland and the alpine steppe by 32% and 56%, respectively, and promoted the VLS of the alpine meadow by 20.5%. It was concluded that overgrazing was the main driver of change to the alpine grassland vegetation on the QTP. The findings suggest that grazing regimes should be adapted in order for them to be sustainable in a warmer future.

Context. Wildfire is a major driver of the structure and function of mallee eucalypt- and spinifex-dominated landscapes. Understanding how fire influences the distribution of biota in these fire-prone environments is essential for effective ecological and conservation-based management.
Aims. We aimed to (1) determine the effects of an extensive wildfire (118 000 ha) on a small mammal community in the mallee shrublands of semiarid Australia and (2) assess the hypothesis that the fire-response patterns of small mammals can be predicted by their life-history characteristics.
Methods. Small-mammal surveys were undertaken concurrently at 26 sites: once before the fire and on four occasions following the fire (including 14 sites that remained unburnt). We documented changes in small-mammal occurrence before and after the fire, and compared burnt and unburnt sites. In addition, key components of vegetation structure were assessed at each site.
Key results. Wildfire had a strong influence on vegetation structure and on the occurrence of small mammals. The mallee ningaui, Ningaui yvonneae, a dasyurid marsupial, showed a marked decline in the immediate post-fire environment, corresponding with a reduction in hummock-grass cover in recently burnt vegetation. Species richness of native small mammals was positively associated with unburnt vegetation, although some species showed no clear response to wildfire.
Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the contention that mammal responses to fire are associated with their known life-history traits. The species most strongly affected by wildfire, N. yvonneae, has the most specific habitat requirements and restricted life history of the small mammals in the study area. The only species positively associated with recently burnt vegetation, the introduced house mouse, Mus domesticus, has a flexible life history and non-specialised resource requirements.
Implications. Maintaining sources for recolonisation after large-scale wildfires will be vital to the conservation of native small mammals in mallee ecosystems.

These patterns are assumed to reflect natural selection via differential predation on genetically determined, fixed phenotypes. Phenotypic variation, however, also can reflect within-generation developmental responses to environmental cues (phenotypic plasticity). For example, water-borne effluents from predators can induce the production of defensive morphologies in many prey taxa. This phenomenon, however, has been examined only on narrow scales. Here, we demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity in prey from geographically separated populations that were reared in the presence of an introduced predator. Marine snails exposed to predatory crab effluent in the field increased shell thickness rapidly compared with controls. Induced changes were comparable to (<jats:italic>i</jats:italic>) historical transitions in thickness previously attributed to selection by the invading predator and (<jats:italic>ii</jats:italic>) present-day clinal variation predicted from water temperature differences. Thus, predator-induced phenotypic plasticity may explain broad-scale geographic and temporal phenotypic variation. If inducible defenses are heritable, then selection on the reaction norm may influence coevolution between predator and prey. Trade-offs may explain why inducible rather than constitutive defenses have evolved in several gastropod species."

Although many studies have searched for either species or habitat characteristics that predict invasiveness of exotic species, the match between characteristics of the invader and those of members of the existing native community may be essential to understanding invasiveness. Here, we find that one metric, the phylogenetic relatedness of an invader to the native community, provides a predictive tool for invasiveness. Using a phylogenetic supertree of all grass species in California, we show that highly invasive grass species are, on average, significantly less related to native grasses than are introduced but noninvasive grasses. The match between the invader and the existing native community may explain why exotic pest species are not uniformly noxious in all novel habitats. Relatedness of invaders to the native biota may be one useful criterion for prioritizing management efforts of exotic species."

            An unresolved question in ecology concerns why the ecological effects of invasions vary in magnitude. Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient biota, whereas others profoundly disrupt the ecosystems they invade through predation, competition, and other mechanisms. In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological invasions seldom considers phenotypic or microevolutionary changes that occur following introduction. Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits (colony size and longevity), together with omnivory, magnifies the predatory impacts of an invasive social wasp (
            <jats:italic>Vespula pensylvanica</jats:italic>

            ) that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial colonies. Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded ecosystems experience. Moreover, postintroduction phenotypic changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in adaptive potential resulting from founder events and small population sizes. The dynamic nature of biological invasions necessitates a more quantitative understanding of how postintroduction changes in invader traits affect invasion processes.

We found that the right inferior frontal cortex can be functionally segregated into two subregions: a dorsal region, which is critical for visual detection of changes in the environment, and a ventral region, which updates the corresponding action plan.

Seronegative chimpanzees inoculated i.v. with the human norovirus strain Norwalk virus (NV) did not show clinical signs of gastroenteritis, but the onset and duration of virus shedding in stool and serum antibody responses were similar to that observed in humans. NV RNA was detected in intestinal and liver biopsies concurrent with the detection of viral shedding in stool, and NV antigen expression was observed in cells of the small intestinal lamina propria.

Chimpanzees vaccinated intramuscularly with GI VLPs were protected from NV infection when challenged 2 and 18 mo after vaccination, whereas chimpanzees that received GII VLPs vaccine or a placebo were not.

The long-term persistence of these exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the exotics are superior competitors. However, seed-addition experiments in a southern California grassland revealed that native perennial species, which had lower requirements for deep soil water, soil nitrate, and light, were strong competitors, and they markedly depressed the abundance and fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed nitrogen, water, and disturbance gradients. Thus, exotic annuals are not superior competitors but rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and the low dispersal abilities and extreme current rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to be general, it may be feasible to restore native California grassland flora to at least parts of its former range."

We then use this information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538 plant and animal species over time, 44% of which have already had local extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57–70% of these 538 species will not disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal, although most studies focus only on dispersal.

However, the nodes are typically highly resource-constrained. Since the communication task is a significant power consumer, various attempts have been made to introduce energy-awareness at different levels within the communication stack. Clustering is one such attempt to control energy dissipation for sensor data dissemination in a multihop fashion. The Time-Controlled Clustering Algorithm (TCCA) is proposed to realize a network-wide energy reduction. A realistic energy dissipation model is derived probabilistically to quantify the sensor network's energy consumption using the proposed clustering algorithm. A discrete-event simulator is developed to verify the mathematical model and to further investigate TCCA in other scenarios. The simulator is also extended to include the rest of the communication stack to allow a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm. "

Our goal was to load EVs with microRNA that are synthesized by the cells that produce the EVs. HEK293T cells were engineered to produce EVs expressing a lysosomal associated membrane, Lamp2a fusion protein. The gene encoding pre‐miR‐199a was inserted into an artificial intron of the Lamp2a fusion protein. The TAT peptide/HIV‐1 transactivation response (TAR) RNA interacting peptide was exploited to enhance the EV loading of the pre‐miR‐199a containing a modified TAR RNA loop. Computational modeling demonstrated a stable interaction between the modified pre‐miR‐199a loop and TAT peptide. EMSA gel shift, recombinant Dicer processing and luciferase binding assays confirmed the binding, processing and functionality of the modified pre‐miR‐199a. The TAT‐TAR interaction enhanced the loading of the miR‐199a into EVs by 65‐fold. Endogenously loaded EVs were ineffective at delivering active miR‐199a‐3p therapeutic to recipient SK‐Hep1 cells. While the low degree of miRNA loading into EVs through this approach resulted in inefficient distribution of RNA cargo into recipient cells, the TAT TAR strategy to load miRNA into EVs may be valuable in other drug delivery approaches involving miRNA mimics or other hairpin containing RNAs."

Due to the exposure of the film to many species during plasma treatment, such as photons, ions, radicals, etc, it is difficult to identify the mechanisms responsible for plasma-induced damage. Using a vacuum beam apparatus with a calibrated Xe vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamp, we show that 147 nm VUV photons and molecular O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> alone can damage these low-<jats:italic>k</jats:italic> materials.

The effect of VUV radiation on chemical modification of porous SiOCH films in the vacuum beam apparatus and in Ar and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> plasma exposure was found to be a significant contributor to dielectric damage. Measurements of dielectric constant change using a mercury probe are consistent with chemical modification inferred from FTIR analysis. Furthermore, the extent of chemical modification appears to be limited by the penetration depth of the VUV photons, which is dependent on wavelength of radiation. The creation of a SiO<jats:sub>

As a result, the rate of methyl loss is continuously changing during the exposure. We present a model that attempts to capture this dynamic behaviour and compare the model predictions to experimental data through a fitting parameter that represents the effective photo-induced methyl removal. While this model accurately simulates the methyl loss through VUV exposure by the Xe lamp and Ar plasma, the methyl loss from VUV photons in O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> plasma are only accurately depicted at longer exposure times. We conclude that other species, such as oxygen radicals or ions, may play a major role in chemical modification at short times near the surface of the material, while VUV photons contribute to the majority of the damage in the bulk."

Absolute atomic oxygen densities are obtained using two photon absorption laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy. The results are interpreted based on measurements of the electron dynamics by phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy in combination with a simple model that balances the production of atomic oxygen with its losses due to chemical reactions and diffusion.

However, since both the out-degree and in-degree of the entities in the knowledge graph follow the power-law distribution, only a small number of entities with higher frequency play a key role in training process, while the others have less effect. This leads to a more serious problem of data sparsity. In this paper, we propose two knowledge graph representation learning models for sub-graph structure fusion. Based on the original model, our models are trained by incorporating the sub-graph structure during training process. By incorporating the sub-graph information into the representation learning model, the structural associations between different relations can be incorporated while considering the semantic association between entities. So that the entities and relations can be modeled more accurately, and the data sparsity problem of the knowledge graph representation learning model can be alleviated effectively."

               Relation extraction is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). The existing methods generally pay more attention on extracting textual semantic information from text, but ignore the relation contextual information from existed relations in datasets, which is very important for the performance of relation extraction task. In this paper, we represent each individual entity as a embedding based on entities and relations knowledge graph, which encodes the relation contextual information between the given entity pairs and relations. Besides, inspired by the impressive performance of language models recently, we used the language model to leverage word semantic information, in which word semantic information can be better captured than word embedding. The experimental results on SemEval2010 Task 8 dataset showed that the F1-score of our proposed method improved nearly 3% compared with the previous methods."

Variable methods and tools are proposed to obtain knowledge within a given domain until now. However, methods on cross-domain knowledge analysis is under-developed. In this paper, domain knowledge graph is built automatically by employing natural language process (NLP) and patent mining. They comprise patent documents obtaining and knowledge extraction. Then according to the international patent classification (IPC), the knowledge elements are divided to some different categories. The elements are stored in Databases and then the given domain knowledge graph is constructed after correlation analyses. The cross-domain knowledge surrounding the given domain knowledge is found by mining the correlation among cross-domain knowledge. The cross-domain knowledge can inspire designers about new design of a given domain. And the efficiency of knowledge reusing can be improved by domain knowledge graphs."

               With the development of intelligent education, it has become one of the more efficient learning schemes to construct the knowledge graph which can excavate the knowledge base.

In this paper, we propose a framework that combines statistical language models, neural network language models, and clustering and clipping algorithms. When processing unstructured text data, unsupervised extraction of representative key words as features of the structured graphs’ entities, so that the processed entity information has more accurate semantics and human learning relevance, and the method of clustering and calculating the learning rate is used to further clarify the learning order and mastery of knowledge points. We have conducted extensive experiments to collect data from the two major modules of HPC high-performance computing courses and domains as datasets, and used this framework to build many knowledge graphs which can provide practical learning.

               Traffic sign detection is an important component of both automatic driving systems and driver assistance systems. However, it is still a big challenge to detect traffic signs quickly and accurately. In this paper, in order to solve this problem, a lightweight algorithm based on YOLOv3 is proposed, which can achieve real-time and accurate traffic sign detection. Firstly, a new lightweight backbone network is proposed by modifying the darknet53 network, which is the original backbone network of YOLOv3. Secondly, in order to further speed up the detection time, depthwise separable convolution is introduced into the proposed backbone network to further reduce the amount of parameters and computations of the model. Thirdly, dense connection is adopted to maintain the accuracy. Experiments on CCTSDB dataset illustrate that the algorithm has great real-time performance and accuracy, which is better than other state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm can detect a 416*416 image in only 3.4 milliseconds, which is 44.3% faster than YOLOv3. In addition, the mAP and F1 value are 97.2% and 91.6% respectively, which are better than YOLOv3."

               Nowadays tourism information services only provide users with massive and fragmented information returned by independent network search which makes users often need to spend a lot of time and energy to find what they really want from the massive data. As a result, route designing is very complicated. In view of this situation, this study builds a tourism knowledge graph based on neo4j and constructs a question answering system (QA). Also, we carry out the model and system performance evaluation, trying to improve the user satisfaction with query experience. According to the structure of question answering system (QA), this research designed and implemented named entity recognition (NER) model based on Bert-BiLSTM-CRF and matching reasoning model based on templates. With the above methods, natural language questions were successfully transformed into cypher query statements recognizable in graph database, and the corresponding answers will be captured and returned from tourism knowledge graph. According to the experiment, the method of Bert-BiLSTM-CRF obtains the state of art and QA system performs quickly and efficiently.

               Since criminals and maritime terrorism may tamper with AIS data and make the track suspicious, it is urgent to classify ships accurately and improve maritime navigation safety. Ship classification based on trajectory data can make up for the deficiency of traditional radar identification and optical identification which has important academic significance and practical value. The target recognition technology based on the traditional neural network can only process conventional Euclidean structure data, while the emerging graph neural network shows great advantages in processing non-Euclidean structure data. The ship trajectory data has the characteristics of the time and space domain and shows a non-Euclidean structure; therefore this paper proposes a classification and recognition method based on the graph neural network to process ship AIS data. First of all, the ship trajectory data is preprocessed and converted into graph data with vertices and edges. Then we use GNN to classify 4 types of ships including fishing vessels, passenger ships, oil tankers, and container ships. Finally, we compare the results with the SVM method. And it shows that this method is valid and proves that it is an effective method of ship classification."

There is a proposed scheme for formalizing indicators set at a qualitative level which is based on membership functions. To determine the form of the membership function, limit, critical and high values of the level of environmental safety are identified. When describing model elements, we use a set of fuzzy situations that characterize the space of possible states of these elements, as well as a set of relationships between them. The assignment of communications that fuzzily is characterized the degree of influence between the typical states of pairs of elements allows the formation of production models in the form of a variety of fuzzy rules. The quantitative result of the interaction of elements is determined on the basis of fuzzy inference.

Capturing richer and more comprehensive information about drug–drug interactions (DDIs) is one of the key tasks in public health and drug development. Recently, several knowledge graph (KG) embedding approaches have received increasing attention in the DDI domain due to their capability of projecting drugs and interactions into a low-dimensional feature space for predicting links and classifying triplets. However, existing methods only apply a uniformly random mode to construct negative samples. As a consequence, these samples are often too simplistic to train an effective model. In this paper, we propose a new KG embedding framework by introducing adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) based on Wasserstein distances and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for DDI tasks. In our framework, the autoencoder is employed to generate high-quality negative samples and the hidden vector of the autoencoder is regarded as a plausible drug candidate. Afterwards, the discriminator learns the embeddings of drugs and interactions based on both positive and negative triplets. Meanwhile, in order to solve vanishing gradient problems on the discrete representation—an inherent flaw in traditional generative models—we utilize the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein distance to train the embedding model steadily. We empirically evaluate our method on two tasks: link prediction and DDI classification. The experimental results show that our framework can attain significant improvements and noticeably outperform competitive baselines.

The fundamental task of identifying gene and protein names is a necessary first step towards making full use of the information encoded in biomedical text. This remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature. We propose to approach the detection of gene and protein names in scientific abstracts as part-of-speech tagging, the most basic form of linguistic corpus annotation.

Results of an experiment on a test corpus of 56K MEDLINE documents demonstrate that our method to extract gene and protein names can be applied to large sets of MEDLINE abstracts, without the need for special conditions or human experts to predetermine relevant subsets.

                  Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising strategy for anticancer therapy, as inhibiting SL partners of genes with cancer-specific mutations can selectively kill the cancer cells without harming the normal cells. Wet-lab techniques for SL screening have issues like high cost and off-target effects. Computational methods can help address these issues. Previous machine learning methods leverage known SL pairs, and the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) can significantly enhance the prediction performance. However, the subgraph structures of KG have not been fully explored. Besides, most machine learning methods lack interpretability, which is an obstacle for wide applications of machine learning to SL identification.

                  We present a model named KR4SL to predict SL partners for a given primary gene. It captures the structural semantics of a KG by efficiently constructing and learning from relational digraphs in the KG. To encode the semantic information of the relational digraphs, we fuse textual semantics of entities into propagated messages and enhance the sequential semantics of paths using a recurrent neural network. Moreover, we design an attentive aggregator to identify critical subgraph structures that contribute the most to the SL prediction as explanations. Extensive experiments under different settings show that KR4SL significantly outperforms all the baselines. The explanatory subgraphs for the predicted gene pairs can unveil prediction process and mechanisms underlying synthetic lethality. The improved predictive power and interpretability indicate that deep learning is practically useful for SL-based cancer drug target discovery.

               Motivation: Scholarly biomedical publications report on the findings of a research investigation. Scientists use a well-established discourse structure to relate their work to the state of the art, express their own motivation and hypotheses and report on their methods, results and conclusions. In previous work, we have proposed ways to explicitly annotate the structure of scientific investigations in scholarly publications. Here we present the means to facilitate automatic access to the scientific discourse of articles by automating the recognition of 11 categories at the sentence level, which we call Core Scientific Concepts (CoreSCs). These include: Hypothesis, Motivation, Goal, Object, Background, Method, Experiment, Model, Observation, Result and Conclusion. CoreSCs provide the structure and context to all statements and relations within an article and their automatic recognition can greatly facilitate biomedical information extraction by characterizing the different types of facts, hypotheses and evidence available in a scientific publication.
               Results: We have trained and compared machine learning classifiers (support vector machines and conditional random fields) on a corpus of 265 full articles in biochemistry and chemistry to automatically recognize CoreSCs. We have evaluated our automatic classifications against a manually annotated gold standard, and have achieved promising accuracies with ‘Experiment’, ‘Background’ and ‘Model’ being the categories with the highest F1-scores (76%, 62% and 53%, respectively). We have analysed the task of CoreSC annotation both from a sentence classification as well as sequence labelling perspective and we present a detailed feature evaluation. The most discriminative features are local sentence features such as unigrams, bigrams and grammatical dependencies while features encoding the document structure, such as section headings, also play an important role for some of the categories. We discuss the usefulness of automatically generated CoreSCs in two biomedical applications as well as work in progress.
               Availability: A web-based tool for the automatic annotation of articles with CoreSCs and corresponding documentation is available online at http://www.sapientaproject.com/softwarehttp://www.sapientaproject.com also contains detailed information pertaining to CoreSC annotation and links to annotation guidelines as well as a corpus of manually annotated articles, which served as our training data.

                  A heterogeneous network topology possessing abundant interactions between biomedical entities has yet to be utilized in similarity-based methods for predicting drug–target associations based on the array of varying features of drugs and their targets. Deep learning reveals features of vertices of a large network that can be adapted in accommodating the similarity-based solutions to provide a flexible method of drug–target prediction.

                  We propose a similarity-based drug–target prediction method that enhances existing association discovery methods by using a topology-based similarity measure. DeepWalk, a deep learning method, is adopted in this study to calculate the similarities within Linked Tripartite Network (LTN), a heterogeneous network generated from biomedical linked datasets. This proposed method shows promising results for drug–target association prediction: 98.96% AUC ROC score with a 10-fold cross-validation and 99.25% AUC ROC score with a Monte Carlo cross-validation with LTN. By utilizing DeepWalk, we demonstrate that: (i) this method outperforms other existing topology-based similarity computation methods, (ii) the performance is better for tripartite than with bipartite networks and (iii) the measure of similarity using network topology outperforms the ones derived from chemical structure (drugs) or genomic sequence (targets). Our proposed methodology proves to be capable of providing a promising solution for drug–target prediction based on topological similarity with a heterogeneous network, and may be readily re-purposed and adapted in the existing of similarity-based methodologies.

                  <jats:title>Motivation</jats:title>
                  Biological knowledge is widely represented in the form of ontology-based annotations: ontologies describe the phenomena assumed to exist within a domain, and the annotations associate a (kind of) biological entity with a set of phenomena within the domain. The structure and information contained in ontologies and their annotations make them valuable for developing machine learning, data analysis and knowledge extraction algorithms; notably, semantic similarity is widely used to identify relations between biological entities, and ontology-based annotations are frequently used as features in machine learning applications.

                  We propose the Onto2Vec method, an approach to learn feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. Our method can be applied to a wide range of bioinformatics research problems such as similarity-based prediction of interactions between proteins, classification of interaction types using supervised learning, or clustering. To evaluate Onto2Vec, we use the gene ontology (GO) and jointly produce dense vector representations of proteins, the GO classes to which they are annotated, and the axioms in GO that constrain these classes. First, we demonstrate that Onto2Vec-generated feature vectors can significantly improve prediction of protein–protein interactions in human and yeast. We then illustrate how Onto2Vec representations provide the means for constructing data-driven, trainable semantic similarity measures that can be used to identify particular relations between proteins. Finally, we use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify protein families based on their Enzyme Commission numbers. Our results demonstrate that Onto2Vec can generate high quality feature vectors from biological entities and ontologies. Onto2Vec has the potential to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in several predictive applications in which ontologies are involved.

                  Ontologies are widely used in biology for data annotation, integration and analysis. In addition to formally structured axioms, ontologies contain meta-data in the form of annotation axioms which provide valuable pieces of information that characterize ontology classes. Annotation axioms commonly used in ontologies include class labels, descriptions or synonyms. Despite being a rich source of semantic information, the ontology meta-data are generally unexploited by ontology-based analysis methods such as semantic similarity measures.

                  We propose a novel method, OPA2Vec, to generate vector representations of biological entities in ontologies by combining formal ontology axioms and annotation axioms from the ontology meta-data. We apply a Word2Vec model that has been pre-trained on either a corpus or abstracts or full-text articles to produce feature vectors from our collected data. We validate our method in two different ways: first, we use the obtained vector representations of proteins in a similarity measure to predict protein–protein interaction on two different datasets. Second, we evaluate our method on predicting gene–disease associations based on phenotype similarity by generating vector representations of genes and diseases using a phenotype ontology, and applying the obtained vectors to predict gene–disease associations using mouse model phenotypes. We demonstrate that OPA2Vec significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting gene–disease associations. Using evidence from mouse models, we apply OPA2Vec to identify candidate genes for several thousand rare and orphan diseases. OPA2Vec can be used to produce vector representations of any biomedical entity given any type of biomedical ontology.

                  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are quickly becoming a common-place tool for storing relationships between entities from which higher-level reasoning can be conducted. KGs are typically stored in a graph-database format, and graph-database queries can be used to answer questions of interest that have been posed by users such as biomedical researchers. For simple queries, the inclusion of direct connections in the KG and the storage and analysis of query results are straightforward; however, for complex queries, these capabilities become exponentially more challenging with each increase in complexity of the query. For instance, one relatively complex query can yield a KG with hundreds of thousands of query results. Thus, the ability to efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of a complex KG represents a major challenge to any effort designed to exploit the use of KGs for applications in biomedical research and other domains. We present Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways as an abstraction layer and user interface to more easily query KGs and store, rank and explore query results.

                  Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.

                  We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

               Humans have a distinguishing ability for fine motor control that is subserved by a highly evolved cortico-motor neuronal network. The acquisition of a particular motor skill involves a long series of practice movements, trial and error, adjustment and refinement. At the cortical level, this acquisition begins in the parieto-temporal sensory regions and is subsequently consolidated and stratified in the premotor-motor cortex. Task-specific dystonia can be viewed as a corruption or loss of motor control confined to a single motor skill. Using a multimodal experimental approach combining neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation, we explored interactions between the principal nodes of the fine motor control network in patients with writer’s cramp and healthy matched controls. Patients and healthy volunteers underwent clinical assessment, diffusion-weighted MRI for tractography, and functional MRI during a finger tapping task. Activation maps from the task-functional MRI scans were used for target selection and neuro-navigation of the transcranial magnetic stimulation. Single- and double-pulse TMS evaluation included measurement of the input-output recruitment curve, cortical silent period, and amplitude of the motor evoked potentials conditioned by cortico-cortical interactions between premotor ventral (PMv)-motor cortex (M1), anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL)-M1, and dorsal inferior parietal lobule (dIPL)-M1 before and after inducing a long term depression-like plastic change to dIPL node with continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation in a randomized, sham-controlled design. Baseline dIPL-M1 and aIPL-M1 cortico-cortical interactions were facilitatory and inhibitory, respectively, in healthy volunteers, whereas the interactions were converse and significantly different in writer’s cramp. Baseline PMv-M1 interactions were inhibitory and similar between the groups. The dIPL-PMv resting state functional connectivity was increased in patients compared to controls, but no differences in structural connectivity between the nodes were observed. Cortical silent period was significantly prolonged in writer’s cramp. Making a long term depression-like plastic change to dIPL node transformed the aIPL-M1 interaction to inhibitory (similar to healthy volunteers) and cancelled the PMv-M1 inhibition only in the writer’s cramp group. These findings suggest that the parietal multimodal sensory association region could have an aberrant downstream influence on the fine motor control network in writer’s cramp, which could be artificially restored to its normal function."

               This study used large-scale time-varying network analysis to reveal the diverse network patterns during the different decision stages and found that the responses of rejection and acceptance involved different network structures. When participants accept unfair offers, the brain recruits a more bottom-up mechanism with a much stronger information flow from the visual cortex (O2) to the frontal area, but when they reject unfair offers, it displayed a more top-down flow derived from the frontal cortex (Fz) to the parietal and occipital cortices. Furthermore, we performed 2 additional studies to validate the above network models: one was to identify the 2 responses based on the out-degree information of network hub nodes, which results in 70% accuracy, and the other utilized theta burst stimulation (TBS) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate the frontal area before the decision-making tasks. We found that the intermittent TBS group demonstrated lower acceptance rates and that the continuous TBS group showed higher acceptance rates compared with the sham group. Similar effects were not observed after TBS of a control site. These results suggest that the revealed decision-making network model can serve as a potential intervention model to alter decision responses."

Results of such tests can be reported as cycle threshold (Ct) values, which may provide semi-quantitative or indirect measurements of viral load. Previous reports have examined temporal trends in Ct values over the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Four (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral loads ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test. The viral load of respiratory samples was then compared and the average viral load in sputum (17 429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, P &amp;lt; .001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, P &amp;lt; .001). Furthermore, the viral loads in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46 800 ± 17 272 vs 1252 ± 1027, P &amp;lt; .001) analyzed by sputum samples.

                  While increasing coverage of effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emergent variants raise concerns about breakthrough infection. Data are limited, however, whether breakthrough infection during the epidemic of the variant is ascribed to insufficient vaccine-induced immunogenicity.

                  We describe incident COVID-19 in relation to the vaccination program among workers of a referral hospital in Tokyo. During the predominantly Delta epidemic, we followed 2415 fully vaccinated staff (BNT162b2) for breakthrough infection and selected 3 matched controls. We measured post-vaccination neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type, Alpha (B.1.1.7), and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains using live viruses and anti-spike antibodies using quantitative assays, and compared them using the generalized estimating equation model between the 2 groups.

                  No COVID-19 cases occurred 1–2 months after the vaccination program during the fourth epidemic wave in Japan, dominated by the Alpha variant, while 22 cases emerged 2–4 months after the vaccination program during the fifth wave, dominated by the Delta variant. In the vaccinated cohort, all 17 cases of breakthrough infection were mild or asymptomatic and participants had returned to work early. There was no measurable difference between cases and controls in post-vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against the wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and anti-spike antibody titers, while neutralizing titers against the variants were considerably lower than those against the wild-type.

               Numerous studies have associated high concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] with atherosclerosis. We developed a rapid, one-step competitive immunochromatographic assay to measure Lp(a) in plasma. The assay is performed on a nitrocellulose membrane strip and the result is determined by a visual readout of rust-colored colloidal selenium. The assay is based on the principle that Lp(a) in the sample will compete with Lp(a)-coated colloidal selenium for binding to the anti-Lp(a) monoclonal antibody immobilized on the assay strip in the format of four ladder bars. The number of capture bars that appear as a result of the formation of colloidal selenium color is proportional to the concentration of the Lp(a) protein in the samples. The strip assay semiquantitatively measures Lp(a) concentrations ranging from 0 to 180 mg/L of Lp(a) protein in serum, plasma, or fingerstick whole-blood samples. This assay appears very useful for quick identification of individuals with above-normal concentrations of plasma Lp(a) protein (&amp;gt; 70 mg/L), and has potential for monitoring a patient's response to treatment with Lp(a)-lowering drugs."

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ’Food Ontology’ consisting of raw foods and ‘multi-component foods’ while the second is a ‘Biomarker Ontology’ containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design) or the application of different enrichment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. Availability: FOBI is freely available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) formats at the project’s Github repository (https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology) and FOBI visualization tool is available in https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/."

Research is most efficient when those hypotheses are based on the entirety of knowledge known to date. Systematic review articles are commonly used in biomedicine to summarize existing knowledge and contextualize experimental data. But the information contained within review articles is typically only expressed as free-text, which is difficult to use computationally. Researchers struggle to navigate, collect and remix prior knowledge as it is scattered in several silos without seamless integration and access. This lack of a structured information framework hinders research by both experimental and computational scientists. To better organize knowledge and data, we built a structured review article that is specifically focused on NGLY1 Deficiency, an ultra-rare genetic disease first reported in 2012. We represented this structured review as a knowledge graph and then stored this knowledge graph in a Neo4j database to simplify dissemination, querying and visualization of the network. Relative to free-text, this structured review better promotes the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). In collaboration with domain experts in NGLY1 Deficiency, we demonstrate how this resource can improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of hypothesis generation. We also developed a read–write interface that allows domain experts to contribute FAIR structured knowledge to this community resource. In contrast to traditional free-text review articles, this structured review exists as a living knowledge graph that is curated by humans and accessible to computational analyses. Finally, we have generalized this workflow into modular and repurposable components that can be applied to other domain areas.

               Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

               Knowledge of the molecular interactions of biological and chemical entities and their involvement in biological processes or clinical phenotypes is important for data interpretation. Unfortunately, this knowledge is mostly embedded in the literature in such a way that it is unavailable for automated data analysis procedures. Biological expression language (BEL) is a syntax representation allowing for the structured representation of a broad range of biological relationships. It is used in various situations to extract such knowledge and transform it into BEL networks. To support the tedious and time-intensive extraction work of curators with automated methods, we developed the BEL track within the framework of BioCreative Challenges. Within the BEL track, we provide training data and an evaluation environment to encourage the text mining community to tackle the automatic extraction of complex BEL relationships. In 2017 BioCreative VI, the 2015 BEL track was repeated with new test data. Although only minor improvements in text snippet retrieval for given statements were achieved during this second BEL task iteration, a significant increase of BEL statement extraction performance from provided sentences could be seen. The best performing system reached a 32% F-score for the extraction of complete BEL statements and with the given named entities this increased to 49%. This time, besides rule-based systems, new methods involving hierarchical sequence labeling and neural networks were applied for BEL statement extraction."

However, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, both at the syntactic and the semantic level, still poses significant challenges for achieving interoperability among biological databases.Results: We introduce an ontology-based federated approach for data integration. We applied this approach to three heterogeneous data stores that span different areas of biological knowledge: (i) Bgee, a gene expression relational database; (ii) Orthologous Matrix (OMA), a Hierarchical Data Format 5 orthology DS; and (iii) UniProtKB, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) store containing protein sequence and functional information. To enable federated queries across these sources, we first defined a new semantic model for gene expression called GenEx. We then show how the relational data in Bgee can be expressed as a virtual RDF graph, instantiating GenEx, through dedicated relational-to-RDF mappings. By applying these mappings, Bgee data are now accessible through a public SPARQL endpoint. Similarly, the materialized RDF data of OMA, expressed in terms of the Orthology ontology, is made available in a public SPARQL endpoint. We identified and formally described intersection points (i.e. virtual links) among the three data sources. These allow performing joint queries across the data stores. Finally, we lay the groundwork to enable nontechnical users to benefit from the integrated data, by providing a natural language template-based search interface."

However, the largest risk reduction can be achieved if the underlying drought index is tailored individually for each farm. This implies that insurers should offer insurance with farm-specific underlying drought index."

                  <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>
                  In multi-label text classification, each textual document is assigned 1 or more labels. As an important task that has broad applications in biomedicine, a number of different computational methods have been proposed. Many of these methods, however, have only modest accuracy or efficiency and limited success in practical use. We propose ML-Net, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, for multi-label classification of biomedical texts.
               </jats:sec>
               <jats:sec>
                  <jats:title>Materials and Methods</jats:title>
                  ML-Net combines a label prediction network with an automated label count prediction mechanism to provide an optimal set of labels. This is accomplished by leveraging both the predicted confidence score of each label and the deep contextual information (modeled by ELMo) in the target document. We evaluate ML-Net on 3 independent corpora in 2 text genres: biomedical literature and clinical notes. For evaluation, we use example-based measures, such as precision, recall, and the F measure. We also compare ML-Net with several competitive machine learning and deep learning baseline models.

                  Our benchmarking results show that ML-Net compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification of biomedical text. ML-Net is also shown to be robust when evaluated on different text genres in biomedicine.

                  ML-Net is able to accuractely represent biomedical document context and dynamically estimate the label count in a more systematic and accurate manner. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, ML-Net does not require human effort for feature engineering and is a highly efficient and scalable approach to tasks with a large set of labels, so there is no need to build individual classifiers for each separate label.

                  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition affecting a significant proportion of the veteran community. A substantial number of veterans with PTSD fail to benefit from trauma-focused psychological therapies or pharmacotherapy or are left with residual symptoms, and therefore, investigation of new and innovative treatment is required. Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) is a novel form of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, which has been shown to improve depression symptoms and associated cognitive deficits. The current pilot study aimed to explore the acceptability, safety, and tolerability of intermittent TBS (iTBS) as a treatment for PTSD in Australian veterans.

                  This study employed a case series, repeated-measures design. Eight Australian Defence Force veterans with PTSD received 20 bilateral iTBS treatments (1 session per day, 5 days per week over a 4-week period) and were assessed on a range of mental health and neuropsychological measures, including the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), at pretreatment, post-treatment, and a 3-month follow-up.

                  Treatment was generally welltolerated, with reported side-effects including mild to moderate site-specific cranial pain and headaches during stimulation, which were relieved with the use of low dose analgesics. No serious side effects or adverse events were reported. Participants exhibited reductions in both PTSD and depression symptom severity (the repeated-measures effect size [dRM] for the CAPS-5 was −1.78, and the HAM-D was −1.16 post-treatment), as well as improvements in working memory and processing speed. Although significance cannot be inferred, these preliminary estimates of effect size indicate change over time.

Large-scale randomized controlled trials of this promising treatment are warranted.

COVID-19 has high transmissibility and could result in acute lung injury in a fraction of patients. By counterbalancing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the fusion receptor of the virus, plays a protective role against the development of complications of this viral infection. Vitamin D can induce the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and regulate the immune system through different mechanisms. Epidemiologic studies of the relationship between vitamin D and various respiratory infections were reviewed and, here, the postulated mechanisms and clinical data supporting the protective role of vitamin D against COVID-19–mediated complications are discussed."

                  Data on (1) outbreak and sporadic cases and (2) asymptomatic controls in the United States and Latin America were analyzed. With multivariate regression models, we assessed relationships between various factors and Ct values, and we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of symptoms and attributable fractions of norovirus. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to define an optimal Ct cutoff to identify disease-causing infections.

Cycle threshold values were significantly different across age groups, norovirus genogroups, timing of specimen collection, outbreak settings, and transmission modes. Genogroup II (GII) Ct values were associated with presence of symptoms (OR = 1.1), allowing us to estimate that 16% of diarrheal disease was attributable to norovirus. The optimized Ct cutoff led to poor sensitivity and specificity for genogroup I and GII.

Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten Hα, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of ∼2.0 × 1033 erg. We found that: (1) during the superflare, the Hα emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14 Å from 8 Å in the low-resolution spectra (R ∼ 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2) some weak Hα/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3) the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and Hα intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated Hα line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and Hα intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares."

               Social interaction is impaired in schizophrenia, including the use of hand gestures, which is linked to poor social perception and outcome. Brain imaging suggests reduced neural activity in a left-lateralized frontoparietal network during gesture preparation; therefore, gesturing might be improved through facilitation of left hemispheric brain areas or via disruption of interhemispheric inhibition from the right homolog. This study tested whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols would improve gesture performance in schizophrenia. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial applied 3 different protocols of rTMS separated by 48 h. Twenty right-handed schizophrenia patients and 20 matched healthy controls received facilitatory intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and placebo over left IPL in randomized order. Primary outcome was change in the test of upper limb apraxia (TULIA), rated from video recordings of hand gesture performance. Secondary outcome was change in manual dexterity using the coin rotation task. Participants improved on both tasks following rTMS compared with baseline. Only patients improved gesture performance following right IPL cTBS compared with placebo (P = .013). The results of the coin rotation parallel those of the TULIA, with improvements following right IPL cTBS in patients (P = .001). Single sessions of cTBS on the right IPL substantially improved both gesture performance accuracy and manual dexterity. The findings point toward an inhibition of interhemispheric rivalry as a potential mechanism of action."

In total, 112 Rhizoctonia solani and 19 binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) isolates were recovered from diseased potato plants, characterized for AG and pathogenicity. The AG identity of the isolates was confirmed using phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. R. solani isolates recovered belonged to AG 3-PT, AG 2-2IIIB, AG 4HG-I, AG 4HG-III, and AG 5, while BNR isolates belonged to AG A and AG R, with frequencies of 74, 6.1, 2.3, 2.3, 0.8, 12.2, and 2.3%, respectively. R. solani AG 3-PT was the most predominant AG and occurred in all the potato-growing regions sampled, whereas the other AG occurred in distinct locations. Different AG grouped into distinct clades, with high maximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood bootstrap support for both R. solani and BNR. An experiment under greenhouse conditions with representative isolates from different AG showed differences in aggressiveness between and within AG. Isolates of AG 2-2IIIB, AG 4HG-III, and AG R were the most aggressive in causing stem canker while AG 3-PT, AG 5, and AG R caused black scurf. This is the first comprehensive survey of R. solani and BNR on potato in South Africa using a molecular-based approach. This is the first report of R. solani AG 2-2IIIB and AG 4 HG-I causing stem and stolon canker and BNR AG A and AG R causing stem canker and black scurf on potato in South Africa. "

Disease ratings are based on subjective, visual estimates of root rot severity (0-to-7 scale, where 0 = healthy and 7 = 100% rotted, foliage dead). Remote sensing was evaluated as an alternative method to assess RCRR. Field plots of sugar beet were inoculated with R. solani AG 2-2 IIIB at different inoculum densities at the 10-leaf stage in 2008 and 2009. Data were collected for (i) hyperspectral reflectance from the sugar beet canopy and (ii) visual ratings of RCRR in 2008 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after inoculation (WAI) and in 2009 at 2, 3, 5, and 9 WAI. Green, red, and near-infrared reflectance and several calculated narrowband and wideband vegetation indices (VIs) were correlated with visual RCRR ratings, and all resulted in strong nonlinear regressions. Values of VIs were constant until at least 26 to 50% of the root surface was rotted (RCRR = 4, wilting of foliage starting to develop) and then decreased significantly as RCRR ratings increased and plants began dying. RCRR also was detected using airborne, color-infrared imagery at 0.25- and 1-m resolution. Remote sensing can detect RCRR but not before initial appearance of foliar symptoms. "

            Tinnitus is the perception of sound in ears or head without corresponding external stimulus. Despite the great amount of literature concerning tinnitus treatment, there are still no evidence-based established treatments for curing or for effectively reducing tinnitus intensity. Sham-controlled studies revealed beneficial effects using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Still, results show moderate, temporary improvement and high individual variability. Subcallosal area (ventral and dorsomedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices) has been implicated in tinnitus pathophysiology. Our objective is to evaluate the use of bilateral, high frequency, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) rTMS in treatment of chronic subjective tinnitus.

            All 3 states use a combination of paper-based and electronic information systems for managing and exchanging data on reportable conditions within the state. The flow of data from local jurisdictions to the state health departments varies considerably. When state and local information systems are not interoperable, manual duplicative data entry and other work-arounds are often required. The results of the assessment show the complexity of disease reporting at the state and local levels and the multiple systems, processes, and resources engaged in preparing, processing, and transmitting data that limit interoperability and decrease efficiency.

            Through this structured assessment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a better understanding of the complexities for surveillance of using commercial off-the-shelf data systems (California and Massachusetts), and CDC-developed National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Base System. More efficient data exchange and use of data will help facilitate interoperability between National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance Systems.

            <jats:title>Objective:</jats:title>
            Evaluating public health surveillance systems is critical to ensuring that conditions of public health importance are appropriately monitored. Our objectives were to qualitatively evaluate 6 state and local health departments that were early adopters of syndromic surveillance in order to (1) understand the characteristics and current uses, (2) identify the most and least useful syndromes to monitor, (3) gauge the utility for early warning and outbreak detection, and (4) assess how syndromic surveillance impacted their daily decision making.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Design:</jats:title>
            We adapted evaluation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and gathered input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subject matter experts in public health surveillance to develop a questionnaire.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Participants:</jats:title>
            We interviewed staff members from a convenience sample of 6 local and state health departments with syndromic surveillance programs that had been in operation for more than 10 years.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
            Three of the 6 interviewees provided an example of using syndromic surveillance to identify an outbreak (ie, cluster of foodborne illness in 1 jurisdiction) or detect a surge in cases for seasonal conditions (eg, influenza in 2 jurisdictions) prior to traditional, disease-specific systems. Although all interviewees noted that syndromic surveillance has not been routinely useful or efficient for early outbreak detection or case finding in their jurisdictions, all agreed that the information can be used to improve their understanding of dynamic disease control environments and conditions (eg, situational awareness) in their communities.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>
            In the jurisdictions studied, syndromic surveillance may be useful for monitoring the spread and intensity of large outbreaks of disease, especially influenza; enhancing public health awareness of mass gatherings and natural disasters; and assessing new, otherwise unmonitored conditions when real-time alternatives are unavailable. Future studies should explore opportunities to strengthen syndromic surveillance by including broader access to and enhanced analysis of text-related data from electronic health records. Health departments may accelerate the development and use of syndromic surveillance systems, including the improvement of the predictive value and strengthening the early outbreak detection capability of these systems. These efforts support getting the right information to the right people at the right time, which is the overarching goal of CDC's Surveillance Strategy.

We demonstrate the utility of EXPO and its ability to describe different experimental domains, by applying it to two experiments: one in high-energy physics and the other in phylogenetics. The use of EXPO made the goals and structure of these experiments more explicit, revealed ambiguities, and highlighted an unexpected similarity.

The disinfecting properties of plasmas are of particular interest, given the threat of antibiotic resistance to modern medicine. Plasma effluents comprise (V)UV photons and various reactive particles, such as accelerated ions and radicals, that modify biomolecules; however, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie plasma-based disinfection has been lacking. Here, we investigate the antibacterial mechanisms of plasma, including the separate, additive and synergistic effects of plasma-generated (V)UV photons and particles at the cellular and molecular levels. Using scanning electron microscopy, we show that plasma-emitted particles cause physical damage to the cell envelope, whereas UV radiation does not. The lethal effects of the plasma effluent exceed the zone of physical damage. We demonstrate that both plasma-generated particles and (V)UV photons modify DNA nucleobases. The particles also induce breaks in the DNA backbone. The plasma effluent, and particularly the plasma-generated particles, also rapidly inactivate proteins in the cellular milieu. Thus, in addition to physical damage to the cellular envelope, modifications to DNA and proteins contribute to the bactericidal properties of cold atmospheric-pressure plasma."

Disruption of the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a key structure for preparation and initiation of a voluntary action, was shown to reduce the temporal linkage between a voluntary key-press action and a subsequent electrocutaneous stimulus. In contrast, disruption of the sensorimotor cortex, which processes signals more directly related to action execution and sensory feedback, had no significant effect.

            Invasive alien species might benefit from phenotypic plasticity by being able to (i) maintain fitness in stressful environments (‘robust’), (ii) increase fitness in favourable environments (‘opportunistic’), or (iii) combine both abilities (‘robust and opportunistic’). Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug,
            <jats:italic>Arion lusitanicus</jats:italic>
            , and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug,

            , and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700–2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production
            <jats:italic>.</jats:italic>
            During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than

            displayed a less adaptive phenotype than
            <jats:italic>A. fuscus</jats:italic>
            . We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions. Warmer summers and milder winters might lead to an expansion of this invasive species to higher altitudes and enhance its spread in the lowlands, supporting the concern that global climate change will increase biological invasions.

We quantify phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion of native and non-native fishes of a large river basin in the American Southwest to test for the mechanisms (environmental filtering versus competitive exclusion) and spatial scales influencing community structure. Contrary to expectations, non-native species were phylogenetically clustered and related to natural environmental conditions, whereas native species were not phylogenetically structured, likely reflecting human-related changes to the basin. The species that are most invasive (in terms of ecological impacts) tended to be the most phylogenetically divergent from natives across watersheds, but not within watersheds, supporting the hypothesis that Darwin's naturalization conundrum is driven by the spatial scale. Phylogenetic distinctiveness may facilitate non-native establishment at regional scales, but environmental filtering restricts local membership to closely related species with physiological tolerances for current environments. By contrast, native species may have been phylogenetically clustered in historical times, but species loss from contemporary populations by anthropogenic activities has likely shaped the phylogenetic signal. Our study implies that fundamental mechanisms of community assembly have changed, with fundamental consequences for the biogeography of both native and non-native species."

            Aquaculture production is projected to expand from land-based operations to the open ocean as demand for seafood grows and competition increases for inputs to land-based aquaculture, such as freshwater and suitable land. In contrast to land-based production, open-ocean aquaculture is constrained by oceanographic factors, such as current speeds and seawater temperature, which are dynamic in time and space, and cannot easily be controlled. As such, the potential for offshore aquaculture to increase seafood production is tied to the physical state of the oceans. We employ a novel spatial model to estimate the potential of open-ocean finfish aquaculture globally, given physical, biological and technological constraints. Finfish growth potential for three common aquaculture species representing different thermal guilds—Atlantic salmon (
            <jats:italic>Salmo salar</jats:italic>
            ), gilthead seabream (

            )—is compared across species and regions and with climate change, based on outputs of a high-resolution global climate model. Globally, there are ample areas that are physically suitable for fish growth and potential expansion of the nascent aquaculture industry. The effects of climate change are heterogeneous across species and regions, but areas with existing aquaculture industries are likely to see increases in growth rates. In areas where climate change results in reduced growth rates, adaptation measures, such as selective breeding, can probably offset potential production losses.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of multicellular organisms are considered part of a solution to this problem, and AMPs produced by bacteria such as colistin are last-resort drugs. Importantly, AMPs differ from many antibiotics in their pharmacodynamic characteristics. Here we implement these differences within a theoretical framework to predict the evolution of resistance against AMPs and compare it to antibiotic resistance. Our analysis of resistance evolution finds that pharmacodynamic differences all combine to produce a much lower probability that resistance will evolve against AMPs. The finding can be generalized to all drugs with pharmacodynamics similar to AMPs. Pharmacodynamic concepts are familiar to most practitioners of medical microbiology, and data can be easily obtained for any drug or drug combination. Our theoretical and conceptual framework is, therefore, widely applicable and can help avoid resistance evolution if implemented in antibiotic stewardship schemes or the rational choice of new drug candidates."

Amphibians have suffered large declines, with more than 16% considered to be threatened by invasive species. We conducted a global meta-analysis of the impacts of alien species on native amphibians to determine which aspects of amphibian ecology are most affected by plant, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, or mammal introductions. Measures of fitness were most strongly affected; amphibian performance was consistently lower in the presence of alien species. While exposure to alien species caused a significant decrease in amphibian behavioural activity when compared with a no species control, this response was stronger towards a control of native impacting species. This indicates a high degree of prey naiveté towards alien species and highlights the importance of using different types of controls in empirical studies. Alien invertebrates had the greatest overall impact on amphibians. This study sets a new agenda for research on biological invasions, highlighting the lack of studies investigating the impacts of alien species on amphibian terrestrial life-history stages. It also emphasizes the strong ecological impacts that alien species have on amphibian fitness and suggests that future introductions or global spread of alien invertebrates could strongly exacerbate current amphibian declines."

Future transports must be ‘cleaner’ and designed to include technologies that will continue to lower engine emissions and reduce community noise. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will be critical to enable the design of these new concepts. In general, the ability to simulate aerodynamic and reactive flows using CFD has progressed rapidly during the past several decades and has fundamentally changed the aerospace design process. Advanced simulation capabilities not only enable reductions in ground-based and flight-testing requirements, but also provide added physical insight, and enable superior designs at reduced cost and risk. In spite of considerable success, reliable use of CFD has remained confined to a small region of the operating envelope due, in part, to the inability of current methods to reliably predict turbulent, separated flows. Fortunately, the advent of much more powerful computing platforms provides an opportunity to overcome a number of these challenges. This paper summarizes the findings and recommendations from a recent NASA-funded study that provides a vision for CFD in the year 2030, including an assessment of critical technology gaps and needed development, and identifies the key CFD technology advancements that will enable the design and development of much cleaner aircraft in the future."

Consequently, urban operational governance and city services are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism that is the key mode of production for smart cities. At the heart of data-driven urbanism is a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logic and calculative rules and procedures, which is underpinned by an instrumental rationality and realist epistemology. This rationality and epistemology are informed by and sustains urban science and urban informatics, which seek to make cities more knowable and controllable. This paper examines the forms, practices and ethics of smart cities and urban science, paying particular attention to: instrumental rationality and realist epistemology; privacy, datafication, dataveillance and geosurveillance; and data uses, such as social sorting and anticipatory governance. It argues that smart city initiatives and urban science need to be re-cast in three ways: a re-orientation in how cities are conceived; a reconfiguring of the underlying epistemology to openly recognize the contingent and relational nature of urban systems, processes and science; and the adoption of ethical principles designed to realize benefits of smart cities and urban science while reducing pernicious effects.This article is part of the themed issue ‘The ethical impact of data science’."

Here we use the Warming Acidification and Sea Level Projector Earth systems model to calculate large ensembles of global sea-level rise (SLR) and ocean pH projections to 2300 for 1.5°C and 2.0°C stabilization scenarios, and a reference unmitigated RCP8.5 scenario. The potential consequences of these projections are then considered for global coastal flooding, small islands, deltas, coastal cities and coastal ecology. Under both stabilization scenarios, global mean ocean pH (and temperature) stabilize within a century. This implies significant ecosystem impacts are avoided, but detailed quantification is lacking, reflecting scientific uncertainty. By contrast, SLR is only slowed and continues to 2300 (and beyond). Hence, while coastal impacts due to SLR are reduced significantly by climate stabilization, especially after 2100, potential impacts continue to grow for centuries. SLR in 2300 under both stabilization scenarios exceeds unmitigated SLR in 2100. Therefore, adaptation remains essential in densely populated and economically important coastal areas under climate stabilization. Given the multiple adaptation steps that this will require, an adaptation pathways approach has merits for coastal areas.

Second, network motility, which generates slime mould behaviour, is driven by distinct oscillations that organize into spatio-temporal wave patterns. Likewise, neural activity in the brain is organized in a variety of oscillations characterized by different frequencies.

The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables.

Evidence from convalescent sera and preclinical studies has identified the viral Spike (S) protein as a key antigenic target for protective immune responses. We have applied an mRNA-based technology platform, RNActive<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>, to develop CVnCoV which contains sequence optimized mRNA coding for a stabilized form of S protein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Following demonstration of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models we performed a dose-escalation phase 1 study in healthy 18-60 year-old volunteers.This interim analysis shows that two doses of CVnCoV ranging from 2 μg to 12 μg per dose, administered 28 days apart were safe. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. There were dose-dependent increases in frequency and severity of solicited systemic adverse events, and to a lesser extent of local reactions, but the majority were mild or moderate and transient in duration. Immune responses when measured as IgG antibodies against S protein or its receptor-binding domain (RBD) by ELISA, and SARS-CoV-2-virus neutralizing antibodies measured by micro-neutralization, displayed dose-dependent increases. Median titers measured in these assays two weeks after the second 12 μg dose were comparable to the median titers observed in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients. Seroconversion (defined as a 4-fold increase over baseline titer) of virus neutralizing antibodies two weeks after the second vaccination occurred in all participants who received 12 μg doses.Preliminary results in the subset of subjects who were enrolled with known SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline show that CVnCoV is also safe and well tolerated in this population, and is able to boost the pre-existing immune response even at low dose levels.Based on these results, the 12 μg dose is selected for further clinical investigation, including a phase 2b/3 study that will investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine CVnCoV."

In theory, statistical regularities of pain through time contain useful information that can be learned, allowing the brain to generate expectations and inform behaviour. To investigate this, we exposed healthy participants to probabilistic sequences of low and high-intensity electrical stimuli to the left hand, containing sudden changes in stimulus frequencies. We demonstrate that humans can learn to extract these regularities, and explicitly predict the likelihood of forthcoming pain intensities in a manner consistent with optimal Bayesian models with dynamic update of beliefs. We studied brain activity using functional MRI whilst subjects performed the task, which allowed us to dissect the underlying neural correlates of these statistical inferences from their uncertainty and update. We found that the inferred frequency (posterior probability) of high intensity pain correlated with activity in bilateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and right caudate. The uncertainty of statistical inferences of pain was encoded in the right superior parietal cortex. An intrinsic part of this hierarchical Bayesian model is the way that unexpected changes in frequency lead to shift beliefs and update the internal model. This is reflected by the KL divergence between consecutive posterior distributions and associated with brain responses in the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. In conclusion, this study extends what is conventionally considered a sensory pain pathway dedicated to process pain intensity, to include the generation of Bayesian internal models of temporal statistics of pain intensity levels in sensorimotor regions, which are updated dynamically through the engagement of premotor, prefrontal and parietal regions."

Interest and feasibility of direct funding mechanisms,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R645457,Information Science,"More and more academics and governements consider that the open access model based on Article Processing Charges (APC) is problematic, not only due to the inequalities it generates and reinforces, but also because it has become unsustainable and even opposed to open access values. They consider that scientific publishing based on a model where both authors and readers do not pay – the so-called Diamond, or non-APC model – should be developed and supported. However, beyond the display of such a support on an international scale, the landscape of Diamond journals is rather in the form of loosely connected archipelagos, and not systematically funded. This article explores the practical conditions to implement a direct funding mechanism to such journals, that is reccurent money provided by a funder to support the publication process. Following several recommendations from institutional actors in the open access world, we consider the hypothesis that such a funding would be fostered by research funding organizations (RFOs), which have been essential to the expansion of the APC model, and now show interest in supporting other models. Based on a questionnaire survey sent to more thant 1000 Diamond Open Access journals, this article analyzes their financial needs, as well as their capacity to interact with funders. It is structured around four issues regarding the implementation of a direct funding model : Do Diamond journals really make use of money, and to what end ? Do they need additional money? Are they able to engage monetary transactions? Are they able to meet RFOs’ visibility requirements? We show that a majority of OA Diamond journals could make use of a direct funding mechanism with certain adjustments. We conclude on the challenges that such a financial stream would spur."

However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&amp;D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions."

Claims that ERP packages are predicated on an understanding of human agency as a procedural affair and of organizations as an extended series of functional or cross‐functional transactions. Accordingly, the massive introduction of ERP packages to organizations is bound to have serious implications that precisely recount the procedural forms by which such packages instrument organizational operations and fashion organizational roles. The conception of human agency and organizational operations in procedural terms may seem reasonable yet it recounts a very specific and, in a sense, limited understanding of humans and organizations. The distinctive status of framing human agency and organizations in procedural terms becomes evident in its juxtaposition with other forms of human action like improvisation, exploration or playing. These latter forms of human involvement stand out against the serial fragmentation underlying procedural action. They imply acting on the world on loose premises that trade off a variety of forms of knowledge and courses of action in attempts to explore and discover alternative ways of coping with reality."

They also see the involvement of suppliers in this process as being crucial to their ability to attain high levels of customer satisfaction. The “less agile” group, on the other hand, can be characterized as more internally focused with a bias toward internal operational outcomes.

The results of the study revealed training efficiency and relevance were critical in the transfer of learning among the study participants. The findings of the study showed combined training efficiency and training relevance enabled training participants to acquire knowledge and skills for application in the workplace and had significantly positive influence in transfer of learning. The work environment, measured by work variability (or flexibility) and work complexity, and the trainee motivation to participate, measured by learning-conducive workplace features, had a positive influence in transfer of learning.

<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>
Because the majority of participants were females (80.1 per cent), this could be one of the limitations to this study. Research has identified that, because of the broad expectations based on sex and different family and occupational roles, men and women differ in their social network communication, participation in CPE, personality traits, gender-related occupational preferences, learning preference and methods of handling workplace conflict. The second limitation is related to the study design. The researchers did not have a control group because of practicality issues. This being a cross-sectional online survey study, all extraneous variables were not controlled such as in the case of a true randomized control study. This study is relying on the information obtained from a self-report training transfer instrument completed by the study participants. The accuracy of the obtained data is dependent on the honesty of the participants and their commitment in providing correct responses.

                – This paper analyses the occurrence regulations and components of meteorological disasters and proposes the concept of meta-action. Ontology modelling method is adopted to describe the components and relationships among different parts comprising meteorological disaster system, and semantic web rule language is selected to identify the implicit relationships among the domain knowledge explicitly defined in ontology model. Besides, a case is studied to elaborate how to provide logic and semantic information support for comprehensive risk assessment of disastrous weather/climate events based on rule-based ontology reasoning method. It proves that ontology modelling and reasoning method is effective in providing decision makings.

For many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the step of distinguishing word semantic relation can help to improve system performance, such as information extraction and knowledge graph generation. Currently, common methods for this task rely on large corpora for training or dictionaries and thesauri for inference, where limitation lies in freely data access and keeping built lexical resources up-date. This paper builds a primary system for classifying Chinese word semantic relations by seeking new ways to obtain the external resources efficiently.

<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Purpose</jats:title>
The increasingly competitive hotel industry and emerging customer trends where guests are more discerning and want a personalized experience has led to the need of innovative applications. Personalization is much more important for hotels, especially now in the post-COVID lockdown era, as it challenges their business model. However, personalization is difficult to design and realize due to the variety of factors and requirements to be considered. Differences are both in the offer (hotels and their rooms) and demand (customers’ profiles and needs) in the accommodation domain. As for the implementation, critical issues are in hardware-dependent and vendor-specific Internet of Things devices which are difficult to program. Additionally, there is complexity in realizing applications that consider varying customer needs and context via existing personalization options. This paper aims to propose an ontological framework to enhance the capabilities of hotels in offering their accommodation and personalization options based on a guest’s characteristics, activities and needs.
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>
A research approach combining both quantitative and qualitative methods was used to develop a hotel room personalization framework. The core of the framework is a hotel room ontology (HoROnt) that supports well-defined machine-readable descriptions of hotel rooms and guest profiles. Hotel guest profiles are modeled via logical rules into an inference engine exploiting reasoning functionalities used to recommend hotel room services and features.
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Findings</jats:title>
Both the ontology and the inference engine module have been validated with promising results which demonstrate high accuracy. The framework leverages user characteristics, and dynamic contextual data to satisfy guests’ needs for personalized service provision. The semantic rules provide recommendations to both new and returning guests, thereby also addressing the cold start issue.
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Originality/value</jats:title>
This paper extends HoROnt in two ways, to be able to add: instances of the concepts (room characteristics and services; guest profiles), i.e. to create a knowledge base, and logical rules into an inference engine, to model guests’ profiles and to be used to offer personalized hotel rooms. Thanks to the standards adopted to implement personalization, this framework can be integrated into existing reservation systems. It can also be adapted for any type of accommodation since it is broad-based and personalizes varying features and amenities in the rooms.

The Barcelona case,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R141942,Urban Studies and Planning,"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Purpose</jats:title>– In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments’ initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>– To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Findings</jats:title>– The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders.

Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels).

<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Purpose</jats:title>
Research data publishing is today widely regarded as crucial for reproducibility, proper assessment of scientific results, and as a way for researchers to get proper credit for sharing their data. However, several challenges need to be solved to fully realize its potential, one of them being the development of a global standard for links between research data and literature. Current linking solutions are mostly based on bilateral, ad hoc agreements between publishers and data centers. These operate in silos so that content cannot be readily combined to deliver a network graph connecting research data and literature in a comprehensive and reliable way. The Research Data Alliance (RDA) Publishing Data Services Working Group (PDS-WG) aims to address this issue of fragmentation by bringing together different stakeholders to agree on a common infrastructure for sharing links between datasets and literature. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
</jats:sec>

<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>
This paper presents the synergic effort of the RDA PDS-WG and the OpenAIRE infrastructure toward enabling a common infrastructure for exchanging data-literature links by realizing and operating the Data-Literature Interlinking (DLI) Service. The DLI Service populates and provides access to a graph of data set-literature links (at the time of writing close to five million, and growing) collected from a variety of major data centers, publishers, and research organizations.
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Findings</jats:title>
To achieve its objectives, the Service proposes an interoperable exchange data model and format, based on which it collects and publishes links, thereby offering the opportunity to validate such common approach on real-case scenarios, with real providers and consumers. Feedback of these actors will drive continuous refinement of the both data model and exchange format, supporting the further development of the Service to become an essential part of a universal, open, cross-platform, cross-discipline solution for collecting, and sharing data set-literature links.
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>

<jats:list>
<jats:list-item>Theory has produced contrasting predictions related to flowering time overlap among coexisting plant species largely because of the diversity of potential influences on flowering time. In this study, we use a trait‐based null modelling approach to test for evidence of deterministic assembly of species according to flowering time in an old‐field plant community.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Plant species coexisting in one‐metre‐square plots overlapped in flowering time significantly more than expected. This flowering synchrony was more pronounced when analyses focused on bee‐pollinated species. Flowering synchrony was also observed for wind‐pollinated species, although for only one of our two null model tests, highlighting the sensitivity of some results to different randomization methods. In general, these patterns suggest that relationships between pollinators and plants can influence community assembly processes.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Because our study community is composed of approximately 43% native plant species and 57% exotic species, and because the arrival of new species may complicate plant–pollinator interactions, we tested whether flowering time overlap was altered by introduced species. Flowering synchrony was greater in plots with a higher proportion of introduced species. This pattern held for both null model tests, but was slightly stronger when analyses focused on bee‐pollinated species. These results indicate that introduced species alter community flowering distributions and in so doing will inevitably affect pollinator–plant interactions.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Finally, we tested whether our results were influenced by variation among study plots in above‐ground biomass production, which some theory predicts will be related to the importance of competition. Our results were not influenced by this variation, suggesting that resource variation among our plots did not contribute to observed patterns.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>: Our results provide support for predictions that coexisting species should display flowering synchrony, and provide no support for species coexistence via temporal niche partitioning at this scale in this study community. Our results also indicate that introduced species significantly alter the community assembly process such that flowering synchrony is more pronounced in plots with a greater proportion of introduced plant species.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item> Although observed functional differences between alien and native plant species support the idea that invasions are favoured by niche differentiation (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ND</jats:styled-content>), when considering invasions along large ecological gradients, habitat filtering (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">HF</jats:styled-content>) has been proposed to constrain alien species such that they exhibit similar trait values to natives.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item> To reconcile these contrasting observations, we used a multiscale approach using plant functional traits to evaluate how biotic interactions with native species and grazing might determine the functional structure of highly invaded grasslands along an elevation gradient in <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">N</jats:styled-content>ew Zealand.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item> At a regional scale, functional differences between alien and native plant species translated into nonrandom community assembly and high <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ND</jats:styled-content>. Alien and native species showed contrasting responses to elevation and the degree of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ND</jats:styled-content> between them decreased as elevation increased, suggesting a role for <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">HF</jats:styled-content>. At the plant‐neighbourhood scale, species with contrasting traits were generally spatially segregated, highlighting the impact of biotic interactions in structuring local plant communities. A confirmatory multilevel path analysis showed that the effect of elevation and grazing was moderated by the presence of native species, which in turn influenced the local abundance of alien species.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item> Our study showed that functional differences between aliens and natives are fundamental to understand the interplay between multiple mechanisms driving alien species success and their coexistence with natives. In particular, the success of alien species is driven by the presence of native species which can have a negative (biotic resistance) or a positive (facilitation) effect depending on the functional identity of alien species.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>Biological invasions are facilitated by the global transportation of species and climate change. Given that invasions may cause ecological and economic damage and pose a major threat to biodiversity, understanding the mechanisms behind invasion success is essential.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Both the release of non‐native populations from natural enemies, such as parasites, and the genetic diversity of these populations may play key roles in their invasion success.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>We investigated the roles of parasite communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic diversity in the invasion success of the non‐native bumblebee, <jats:italic>Bombus hypnorum</jats:italic>, in the United Kingdom.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>The invasive <jats:italic>B. hypnorum</jats:italic> had higher parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two high‐impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on <jats:italic>B. hypnorum</jats:italic> queens’ survival and colony‐founding success than on native species. <jats:italic>Bombus hypnorum</jats:italic> also had lower functional genetic diversity at the sex‐determining locus than native species. Higher parasite prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid invasion of the United Kingdom by <jats:italic>B. hypnorum</jats:italic>. These data may inform our understanding of similar invasions by commercial bumblebees around the world.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>Climate over Asian montane rangelands is changing faster than the global average, posing serious threats to the future of the region's livestock‐based economies and cultures. Effects of climate change on rangeland vegetation likely depend on grazing by herbivores but the potential responses of vegetation to such changes in climate and grazing regimes remain unclear.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>We examined vegetation responses to experimentally simulated climate change (warming, drought and increased rainfall) and grazing (clipping vegetation) between 2015 and 2018 at two mountain rangeland sites: Spiti valley, in the Indian Trans‐Himalaya and Tost, in the Gobi‐Altai Mountains in Mongolia.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Clipping and climate change manipulations interactively reduced vegetation cover and biomass but did not affect species richness. Treatment effects and their interactions varied between sites. In ungrazed plots, vegetation cover and biomass declined sharply in response to warming (18%–35%) and drought (20%–50%) at the two sites, and, surprisingly also declined slightly in response to increased rainfall (20%) at Tost. While the effects of climate treatments were largely similar in the grazed and ungrazed plots in Tost, they were larger in the ungrazed plots in Spiti. The decline in vegetation cover was driven by a decline in the cover of both forbs and grasses.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In combination, grazing and warming (Tost) or drought (Spiti) had sub‐additive effects, that is, the decrease in vegetation cover in response to grazing and warming/drought was less than the sum of their independent effects but greater than the effect of either manipulation alone. Of the two, warming had a greater effect than drought at the more arid site (Tost), whereas drought had a larger effect at the more mesic site (Spiti).</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. Our findings show that future changes in climate, including just over 1°C of warming, could undermine the sustainability of pastoral economies and the persistence of wildlife across Asian montane rangelands. Furthermore, grazing by herbivores will play an important role in mediating rangeland responses to climate change; thus, pasture management in concert with local pastoralists will be crucial in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on rangelands, pastoral livelihoods and wildlife populations.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>In their colonized ranges, exotic plants may be released from some of the herbivores or pathogens of their home ranges but these can be replaced by novel enemies. It is of basic and practical interest to understand which characteristics of invaded communities control accumulation of the new pests. Key questions are whether enemy load on exotic species is smaller than on native competitors as suggested by the enemy release hypothesis (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ERH</jats:styled-content>) and whether this difference is most pronounced in resource‐rich habitats as predicted by the resource–enemy release hypothesis (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">R</jats:styled-content>‐<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ERH</jats:styled-content>).</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In 72 populations of 12 exotic invasive species, we scored all visible above‐ground damage morphotypes caused by herbivores and fungal pathogens. In addition, we quantified levels of leaf herbivory and fruit damage. We then assessed whether variation in damage diversity and levels was explained by habitat fertility, by relatedness between exotic species and the native community or rather by native species diversity.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In a second part of the study, we also tested the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ERH</jats:styled-content> and the <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">R</jats:styled-content>‐<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">ERH</jats:styled-content> by comparing damage of plants in 28 pairs of co‐occurring native and exotic populations, representing nine congeneric pairs of native and exotic species.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In the first part of the study, diversity of damage morphotypes and damage levels of exotic populations were greater in resource‐rich habitats. Co‐occurrence of closely related, native species in the community significantly increased the probability of fruit damage. Herbivory on exotics was less likely in communities with high phylogenetic diversity.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In the second part of the study, exotic and native congeneric populations incurred similar damage diversity and levels, irrespective of whether they co‐occurred in nutrient‐poor or nutrient‐rich habitats.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Negative feedbacks generated by European soil varied idiosyncratically among sites and species.

Comparing both years, understorey plant species‐richness, species composition, soil <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">pH</jats:styled-content> and woody basal area of the tree and shrub canopy were measured.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>We tested the hypothesis that the storm had deflected sites from the wider national trajectory of an increase in woody basal area and reduced understorey species‐richness associated with ageing canopies and declining woodland management.

<jats:list-item>By 2002, storm exposure was estimated to have increased mean species richness per 200 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> by 32%. Woody basal area changes were highly variable and did not significantly differ with storm exposure.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Increasing soil p<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">H</jats:styled-content> was associated with a 7% increase in richness.

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>Although impacts of alien plants on species richness are widely reported, it remains unclear how common such effects might be and whether they differ from those due to native species. To date, too few studies have examined the impacts of a wide enough spectrum of native and alien species to address the importance of geographic origin on the richness of plant communities.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>We investigated how total plant species richness, as well as its separate alien and native components, varied with the abundance of 115 alien and 146 native plant species across Banks Peninsula in New Zealand. Using null models, we tested whether significant correlations between the abundance of each focal species and species richness were more frequent than expected by chance. Examination of the differences in the relationships with species abundance found for native and alien richness can shed light as to whether alien species might be acting as drivers of biodiversity change or passengers responding to external environmental factors.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Significant relationships were rarely found for total richness due to contrasting trends of native and alien richness with species abundance. In contrast to natives, an increase in the abundance of an alien species revealed more frequent negative relationships with native richness and positive correlations with alien richness.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>The relationship with species abundance found for native and alien components of richness differed between grasslands and woodlands. While we found putative support for negative impacts on native richness for several alien species in grasslands, the similar negative correlations in woodlands were more likely to reflect the shade intolerance of alien grasses where native species richness was high.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our analyses reveal that widespread alien and native species play different roles in the plant communities in which they co‐occur. Separately analysing the relationship with species abundance for alien and native components of richness can help distinguish between situations where aliens may be acting as the primary drivers in plant community changes or simply passengers. This is an essential first step in designing further experimental studies to determine the underlying ecological processes and potential ecosystem impacts of alien species.</jats:list-item>

In a two‐year multisite field experiment, we assessed the establishment success of seeds and seedlings separately, under all factorial combinations of low vs. high disturbance (mowing vs mowing and tilling of the upper soil layer), suppression or not of pathogens (biocide application) and, for seedlings only, reduction or not of herbivores (net‐cages).</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Native species showed greater establishment success than alien species across all treatments, regardless of their commonness. Moreover, establishment success of all species was positively affected by disturbance. Aliens showed lower establishment success in undisturbed sites with biocide application. Release of the undisturbed resident community from pathogens by biocide application might explain this lower establishment success of aliens. These findings were consistent for establishment from either seeds or seedlings, although less significantly so for seedlings, suggesting a more important role of pathogens in very early stages of establishment after germination. Herbivore exclusion did play a limited role in seedling establishment success.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>: In conclusion, we found that less disturbed grassland communities exhibited strong biotic resistance to establishment success of species, whether alien or native. However, we also found evidence that alien species may benefit weakly from soilborne enemy release, but that this advantage over native species is lost when the latter are also released by biocide application. Thus, disturbance was the major driver for plant species establishment success and effects of pathogens on alien plant establishment may only play a minor role.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>Invasive plants are hypothesized to have higher fitness in introduced areas due to their release from pathogens and herbivores and the relocation of resources to reproduction. However, few studies have tested this hypothesis in native and introduced regions. A biogeographical approach is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms involved in plant invasions and to detect rapid evolutionary changes in the introduced area.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>Reproduction was assessed in native and introduced ranges of two invasive Australian woody legumes, <jats:italic>Acacia dealbata</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. longifolia</jats:italic>. Seed production, pre‐dispersal seed predation, seed and elaiosome size and seedling size were assessed in 7–10 populations from both ranges, taking into account the effect of differences in climate.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>There was a significantly higher percentage of fully developed seeds per pod, a lower proportion of aborted seeds and the absence of pre‐dispersal predation in the introduced range for both <jats:italic>Acacia</jats:italic> species. <jats:italic>Acacia longifolia</jats:italic> produced more seeds per pod in the invaded range, whereas <jats:italic>A. dealbata</jats:italic> produced more seeds per tree in the invaded range. Seeds were bigger in the invaded range for both species, and elaiosome: seed ratio was smaller for <jats:italic>A. longifolia</jats:italic> in the invaded range. Seedlings were also larger in the invaded range, suggesting that the increase in seed size results into greater offspring growth.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>There were no differences in the climatic conditions of sites occupied by <jats:italic>A. longifolia</jats:italic> in both regions. Minimum temperature was higher in Portuguese <jats:italic>A. dealbata</jats:italic> populations, but this difference did not explain the increase in seed production and seed size in the introduced range. It did have, however, a positive effect on the number of pods per tree.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>Acacia dealbata</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. longifolia</jats:italic> escape pre‐dispersal predation in the introduced range and display a higher production of fully developed seeds per fruit and bigger seeds. These differences may explain the invasion of both species because they result in an increased seedling growth and the production of abundant soil seedbanks in the introduced area.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item>The impacts of alien plants on native richness are usually assessed at small spatial scales and in locations where the alien is at high abundance. But this raises two questions: to what extent do impacts occur where alien species are at low abundance, and do local impacts translate to effects at the landscape scale?</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>In an analysis of 47 widespread alien plant species occurring across a 1,000 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> landscape, we examined the relationship between their local abundance and native plant species richness in 594 grassland plots. We first defined the critical abundance at which these focal alien species were associated with a decline in native <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐richness (plot‐scale species numbers), and then assessed how this local decline was translated into declines in native species <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>‐richness (landscape‐scale species numbers).</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>After controlling for sampling biases and environmental gradients that might lead to spurious relationships, we found that eight out of 47 focal alien species were associated with a significant decline in native <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐richness as their local abundance increased. Most of these significant declines started at low to intermediate classes of abundance. For these eight species, declines in native <jats:italic>γ</jats:italic>‐richness were, on average, an order of magnitude (32.0 vs. 2.2 species) greater than those found for native <jats:italic>α</jats:italic>‐richness, mostly due to spatial homogenization of native communities. The magnitude of the decrease at the landscape scale was best explained by the number of plots where an alien species was found above its critical abundance.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:italic>Synthesis.</jats:italic> Even at low abundance, alien plants may impact native plant richness at both local and landscape scales. Local impacts may result in much greater declines in native richness at larger spatial scales. Quantifying impact at the landscape scale requires consideration of not only the prevalence of an alien plant, but also its critical abundance and its effect on native community homogenization. This suggests that management approaches targeting only those locations dominated by alien plants might not mitigate impacts effectively. Our integrated approach will improve the ranking of alien species risks at a spatial scale appropriate for prioritizing management and designing conservation policies.</jats:list-item>

The present study aimed to predict future shifts in major kelp species in northern Japan under different climate change scenarios. From a database of cold temperate kelp species in Japan, we extracted 1,958 data points to estimate the distribution of 11 kelp species that inhabit the waters around northern Japan. Distributions of the past (1980s) and the future (2040s and 2090s) were estimated using a species distribution model (MaxEnt). Variation in summer and winter sea surface temperatures was the factor most responsible for the estimated distribution patterns for most species; the length of natural rocky coasts and wave height were also important for some species. A forecast of shifts in distributions based on different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios showed that kelp species diversity in Japan would significantly decrease. By the 2090s, their habitat range overall was estimated to decline to 30–51% of that of the 1980s with moderate warming (Representative concentration pathways [RCP] 4.5) and to 0–25% with severe warming (RCP 8.5). The model predicted that 6 of 11 cold temperate kelp species may become extinct around Japan by the 2090s (RCP 8.5).

However, the conceptualizations of transactional distance in a telecommunication era have not been systematically addressed. Investigating 71 learners' experiences with WorldWide Web, this study examined the postulate of Moore's theory and identified the dimensions (factors) constituting transactional distance in such learning environment. Exploratory factor analysis using a principal axis factor method was carried out. It was concluded that this concept represented multifaceted ideas. Transactional distance consisted of four dimensions—instructor‐learner, learner‐learner, learner‐content, and learner‐interface transactional distance.

Theoretical ecology and empirical data support the potential of introduced mammals to drive native species to extinction, indeed the majority of practical evidence comes from insular environments, where conditions may differ from the mainland. We analyzed the effects of an introduced lagomorph, the eastern cottontail <jats:italic>Sylvilagus floridanus</jats:italic> on two native mammals, the European hare <jats:italic>Lepus europaeus</jats:italic> and the red fox <jats:italic>Vulpes vulpes</jats:italic>. We used relative abundances collected over 8 years at 30 protected areas in Italy. A generalized linear mixed model was fit to test various hypotheses about the relationships between cottontails, foxes and climatic conditions over the abundance of native hares. In our model, hare and cottontail abundances did not show a negative relationship and we believe that no direct competition occurs between the two species. However, the relationship between fox and hare abundances, positive when cottontails were scarce, became more and more negative as cottontails increased: this supports the hypothesis that indirect dynamics like apparent competition exists between the two lagomorphs. Climatic conditions, expressed through the North Atlantic Oscillation, did not affect the relationship between cottontail and hare abundances. As the impact of parasites on mammal populations is generally climate dependent, we believe that cottontails do not play a direct role in the cycle of parasites affecting hares. Our results provide a clue that an invasive mammal, the eastern cottontail, is modifying the predator–prey relationship between two native species in a non‐insular environment. The existence of such dynamics should lead wildlife managers to account for the effect of introduced species in their decision making, directing control activities on cottontails and not on native foxes."

We argue that walking methods are especially well suited to studying post‐conflict spatial arrangements, yet remain underutilised for a variety of reasons. Specifically, we argue that walking methods can “trouble” dominant productions of post‐conflict space, revealing its storied depth, multi‐temporality, and the alternative narratives of the past that frequently remain hidden in places touched by violence. Critically, employing such place‐sensitive approaches challenges “bad scripts” that reify polarised narratives of conflicted places, thereby enabling the writing of new spatial stories that are potentially generative of new research questions and scholarly insights rooted in overlooked, marginalised, or taken‐for‐granted people, places, and landscapes. Informed by both authors' ongoing research journeys, we argue that walking in troubled places can help scholars dig into the reservoirs of emotion, affect, vitality, and multi‐temporality people experience in post‐conflict landscapes, thus opening up new research vistas in places scholars might not have sought to look using only sedentary methods."

The sharp decrease in forb and graminoid cover in 2011 is likely related to drought conditions since the fire. Annual/biennial forb and graminoid cover decreased relative to perennial cover through time, consistent with the initial floristics hypothesis. Exotic plant response was highly variable and not limited to the immediate post‐fire, annual/biennial community.

To address this challenge, a design‐based research (DBR) was employed to develop and explore a teacher professional development (TPD) model for supporting teachers in designing TEL environments for outdoor inquiry. The study included two exploratory iterations, both implemented within TPD programs comprised of three stages (teachers‐as‐learners, teachers‐as‐designers, teachers‐as‐enactors). Analysis of the TEL environments' teachers designed in the first iteration revealed insufficient supports for students' seamless learning. Based on these findings, we developed the Supporting Outdoor Inquiry Learning (SOIL) guidelines to support teachers in designing seamless flows of activities for learning within and between four dimensions: scientific practices, outdoor learning, physical settings and social activity structures.

Marine avifauna of the island were surveyed yearly 4 years before to 4 years after rodent eradication (conducted in 2005), and we conducted multiple one‐time surveys from ∼10 years before and ∼15 years after eradication. We sought to determine how different seabird species responded to the eradication of invasive rodents in an insular environment. Three species responded positively (two‐ to 10‐fold increase in population size) to eradication with differences in lag time and sensitivity. The number of breeding pairs increased (effect sizes = 0.49–0.95 and 0.35–0.52) for two species over 4 years post‐eradication due to immigration. One species had a longer (at least 5 years) response time than all others; breeding pairs increased for over 10 years after eradication. Long‐term sampling was necessary to observe the responses of the seabird populations on the island because of the delayed response of a species to eradication not visible in the first years after eradication. Our results confirmed the positive effects of eradication of invasive non‐native species on seabirds and emphasize the importance of mid‐ and long‐term pre‐ and posteradication surveys to decipher the mechanisms of seabird recovery and confirm the benefits of eradication for conservation purposes."

When combined, CSWL and SLCL potentially modulate each other's influence, revealing how word learners deal with multiple mechanisms simultaneously: Do they use all mechanisms? Prefer one? Is their strategy context dependent? Three experiments conducted with adult learners reveal that learners prioritize SLCL over CSWL.

Wildlife collision data from the Maine Department of Transportation on other wildlife species support our finding of drastic declines in wildlife road mortality in spring 2020 when compared with immediately previous and subsequent years. Additionally, we find that frogs suffer significantly higher road mortality than salamanders, particularly when conditions are warmer and wetter."

Overall, we find a steady increase in OA publishing in the region over this period, although the proportion of OA publications remains low. The study finds that: (1) open access articles by researchers in sub‐Saharan Africa are concentrated in journals with a lower impact factor; and (2) authors in sub‐Saharan Africa tend to publish in higher quality journals behind a paywall, rather than in lower quality journals that either have no or lower cost for open access."

In order to protect native birds, we aimed to identify factors that influence their vulnerability to the impacts of alien birds. We first reviewed the literature to identify native bird species sustaining such impacts. We then assigned impact severity scores to each native bird species, depending on the severity of the impacts sustained, and performed two types of analyses. First, we used contingency table tests to examine the distribution of impacts across their severity, type and location, and across native bird orders. Second, we used mixed‐effects models to test factors hypothesised to influence the vulnerability of native birds to the impacts of alien birds.Ground‐nesting shorebirds and seabirds were more prone to impacts through predation, while cavity‐nesting woodpeckers and parrots were more prone to impacts through competition. Native bird species were more vulnerable when they occupied islands, warm regions, regions with climatic conditions similar to those in the native range of the invading alien species, and when they were physically smaller than the invading alien species. To a lesser extent, they were also vulnerable when they shared habitat preferences with the invading alien species.By considering the number and type of native bird species affected by alien birds, we demonstrate predation impacts to be more widespread than previously indicated, but also that damaging predation impacts may be underreported. We identify vulnerable orders of native birds, which may require conservation interventions; characteristics of native birds that increase their vulnerability, which may be used to inform risk assessments; and regions where native birds are most vulnerable, which may direct management interventions. The impacts sustained by native birds may be going unnoticed in many regions of the world: there is a clear need to identify and manage them."

Teaching strategies need to change and so do the competences teachers need to develop so as to empower 21st‐century learners. The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) represents a paradigmatic example of this endeavour, taking stock of these needs. Defining the requirements of education professionals by teacher competence frameworks can serve multiple purposes at different levels in education systems. At the micro level, it can support and guide teachers' practice and continuous professional development. At the meso level of local education governance, it can support the development of school institutions as learning organisations, providing common ground for dialogue, collaboration and reflection in professional communities of practice. At the macro level of quality assurance, it can provide reference standards for initial teacher education, and for education professionals' quality along the career continuum. The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators was designed to align with institutional and contextual requirements in different countries, whilst remaining open to adaptation and updating. It links teachers' and students' digital competence development, and can be linked to institutional capacity building. At the same time, the framework is generic enough to apply to different educational settings and to allow for adaptation as technological possibilities and constraints evolve."

However, there is little knowledge on why some invasions spread faster than others at large spatiotemporal scales. Here, we examine the effects of human activities, species traits and characteristics of the invaded range on spread rates using a global sample of alien reptile and amphibian introductions. We show that spread rates vary remarkably among invaded locations within a species, and differ across biogeographical realms. Spread rates are positively related to the richness of native congeneric species and human‐assisted dispersal in the invaded range but are negatively correlated with topographic heterogeneity. Our findings highlight the importance of environmental characteristics and human‐assisted dispersal in developing robust frameworks for predicting species' range shifts."

In this paper, we present a neural model that first combines co‐attention mechanism with graph convolutional network for entity linking with knowledge graphs, which extracts features of mentions and entities from their contexts automatically. Specifically, given the context of a mention and one of its candidate entities' context, we introduce the co‐attention mechanism to learn the relatedness between the mention context and the candidate entity context, and build the mention representation in consideration of such relatedness. Moreover, we propose a context‐aware graph convolutional network for entity representation, which takes both the graph structure of the candidate entity and its relatedness with the mention context into consideration.

Due to the importance of the issue, a large number of researchers have begun to collect English datasets and to study COVID‐19 fake news detection. However, there are a large number of low‐resource languages, including Persian, that cannot develop accurate tools for automatic COVID‐19 fake news detection due to the lack of annotated data for the task. In this article, we aim to develop a corpus for Persian in the domain of COVID‐19 where the fake news is annotated and to provide a model for detecting Persian COVID‐19 fake news. With the impressive advancement of multilingual pre‐trained language models, the idea of cross‐lingual transfer learning can be proposed to improve the generalization of models trained with low‐resource language datasets. Accordingly, we use the state‐of‐the‐art deep cross‐lingual contextualized language model, XLM‐RoBERTa, and the parallel convolutional neural networks to detect Persian COVID‐19 fake news.

However, several studies have now demonstrated that niche tracking is imperfect, that species’ climate niches may vary with population trends, and that geographic distributions may lag behind rapid climate change. These reports of imperfect niche tracking imply shifts in species’ realized climate niches. We argue that quantifying climate niche shifts and analyzing them for a suite of species reveal general patterns of niche shifts and the factors affecting species’ ability to track climate change. We analyzed changes in realized climate niche between 1984 and 2012 for 46 species of North American birds in relation to population trends in an effort to determine whether species differ in the ability to track climate change and whether differences in niche tracking are related to population trends. We found that increasingly abundant species tended to show greater levels of niche expansion (climate space occupied in 2012 but not in 1980) compared to declining species. Declining species had significantly greater niche unfilling (climate space occupied in 1980 but not in 2012) compared to increasing species due to an inability to colonize new sites beyond their range peripheries after climate had changed at sites of occurrence. Increasing species, conversely, were better able to colonize new sites and therefore showed very little niche unfilling. Our results indicate that species with increasing trends are better able to geographically track climate change compared to declining species, which exhibited lags relative to changes in climate. These findings have important implications for understanding past changes in distribution, as well as modeling dynamic species distributions in the face of climate change."

Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground‐ and remote sensing‐ based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process‐based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape‐level."

Given mariculture's substantial contribution to global seafood production and its growing significance in recent decades, it is essential to evaluate the effects of climate change on mariculture and their socio‐economic consequences. Here, we projected climate change impacts on the marine aquaculture diversity for 85 of the currently most commonly farmed fish and invertebrate species in the world's coastal and/or open ocean areas. Results of ensemble projections from three Earth system models and three species distribution models show that climate change may lead to a substantial redistribution of mariculture species richness potential, with an average of 10%–40% decline in the number of species being potentially suitable to be farmed in tropical to subtropical regions. In contrast, mariculture species richness potential is projected to increase by about 40% at higher latitudes under the ‘no mitigation policy’ scenario (RCP 8.5) by the mid‐21st century. In Exclusive Economic Zones where mariculture is currently undertaken, we projected an average future decline of 1.3% and 5% in mariculture species richness potential under RCP 2.6 (‘strong mitigation’) and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the 2050s relative to the 2000s. Our findings highlight the opportunities and challenges for climate adaptation in the mariculture sector through the redistribution of farmed species and expansion of mariculture locations.

The key features of our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered.

From a social welfare perspective, this results in undue pressure on the central bank to extract seigniorage. Monetary policy also suffers from an expansive bias, owing to the authorities’ inability to precommit to price stability. Such a conjecture about the fiscal‐monetary policy mix appears quite relevant in Africa, with deep implications for the incentives of fiscally heterogeneous countries to form a currency union. We calibrate the model to data for West Africa and use it to assess proposed ECOWAS monetary unions. Fiscal heterogeneity indeed appears critical in shaping regional currency blocs that would be mutually beneficial for all their members. In particular, Nigeria's membership in the configurations currently envisaged would not be in the interests of other ECOWAS countries unless it were accompanied by effective containment on Nigeria's financing needs.

<jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item>The use of off‐season burns to control exotic vegetation shows promise for land managers. In California, wildfires tend to occur in the summer and autumn, when most grassland vegetation is dormant. The effects of spring fires on native bunchgrasses have been examined but their impacts on native forbs have received less attention.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>We introduced <jats:italic>Erodium macrophyllum</jats:italic>, a rare native annual forb, by seeding plots in 10 different areas in a California grassland. We tested the hypotheses that <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> would perform better (increased fecundity and germination) when competing with native grasses than with a mixture of exotic and native grasses, and fire would alter subsequent demography of <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> and other species’ abundances. We monitored the demography of <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> for two seasons in plots manually weeded so that they were free from exotics, and in areas that were burned or not burned the spring after seeding.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Weeding increased <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> seedling emergence, survival and fecundity during both seasons. When vegetation was burned in June 2001 (at the end of the first growing season) to kill exotic grass seeds before they dispersed, all <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> plants had finished their life cycle and dispersed seeds, suggesting that burns at this time of year would not directly impact on fecundity. In the growing season after burning (2002), burned plots had less recruitment of <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> but more establishment of native grass seedlings, suggesting burning may differentially affect seedling recruitment.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>At the end of the second growing season (June 2002), burned plots had less cover of exotic and native grasses but more cover of exotic forbs. Nevertheless, <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> plants in burned plots had greater fecundity than in non‐burned plots, suggesting that exotic grasses are more competitive than exotic forbs.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>A glasshouse study showed that exotic grasses competitively suppress <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> to a greater extent than native grasses, indicating that the poor performance of <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> in the non‐burned plots was due to exotic grass competition.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item> <jats:italic>Synthesis and applications.</jats:italic> This study illustrates that fire can alter the competitive environment in grasslands with differential effects on rare forbs, and that exotic grasses strongly interfere with <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic>. For land managers, the benefits of prescribed spring burns will probably outweigh the costs of decreased <jats:italic>E. macrophyllum</jats:italic> establishment. Land managers can use spring burns to cause a flush of native grass recruitment and to create an environment that is, although abundant with exotic forbs, ultimately less competitive compared with non‐burned areas dominated by exotic grasses.</jats:list-item>

<jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item>Biological invasion can permanently alter ecosystem structure and function. Invasive species are difficult to eradicate, so methods for constraining invasions would be ecologically valuable. We examined the potential of ecological restoration to constrain invasion of an old field by <jats:italic>Agropyron cristatum</jats:italic>, an introduced C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> grass.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>A field experiment was conducted in the northern Great Plains of North America. One‐hundred and forty restored plots were planted in 1994–96 with a mixture of C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> native grass seed, while 100 unrestored plots were not. Vegetation on the plots was measured periodically between 1994 and 2002.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item> <jats:italic>Agropyron cristatum</jats:italic> invaded the old field between 1994 and 2002, occurring in 5% of plots in 1994 and 66% of plots in 2002, and increasing in mean cover from 0·2% in 1994 to 17·1% in 2002. However, <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> invaded one‐third fewer restored than unrestored plots between 1997 and 2002, suggesting that restoration constrained invasion. Further, <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> cover in restored plots decreased with increasing planted grass cover. Stepwise regression indicated that <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> cover was more strongly correlated with planted grass cover than with distance from the <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> source, species richness, percentage bare ground or percentage litter.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>The strength of the negative relationship between <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> and planted native grasses varied among functional groups: the correlation was stronger with species with phenology and physiology similar to <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> (i.e. C<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> grasses) than with dissimilar species (C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grasses).</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Richness and cover of naturally establishing native species decreased with increasing <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> cover. In contrast, restoration had little effect on the establishment and colonization of naturally establishing native species. Thus, <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic> hindered colonization by native species while planted native grasses did not.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item> <jats:italic>Synthesis and applications</jats:italic>. To our knowledge, this study provides the first indication that restoration can act as a filter, constraining invasive species while allowing colonization by native species. These results suggest that resistance to invasion depends on the identity of species in the community and that restoration seed mixes might be tailored to constrain selected invaders. Restoring areas before invasive species become established can reduce the magnitude of biological invasion.</jats:list-item>

We explored resistance to plant invaders by eliminating or decreasing the number of understory plant species in particular functional groups from plots at a riparian site in southwestern Virginia, USA. Our functional groups comprise combinations of aboveground biomass and rooting structure type. Manipulated plots were planted with 10 randomly chosen species from widespread native and introduced plants commonly found throughout the floodplains of Big Stony Creek. We assessed success of an invasion by plant survivorship and growth. We analyzed survivorship of functional groups with loglinear models for the analysis of categorical data in a 4‐way table. There was a significant interaction between functional groups removed in a plot and survivorship in the functional groups added to that plot. However, survivorship of species in functional groups introduced into plots with their respective functional group removed did not differ from survivorship when any other functional group was removed. Additionally, growth of each of the most abundant species did not differ significantly among plots with different functional groups manipulated. Specifically, species did not fare better in those plots that had representatives of their own functional group removed. Fox's assembly rule does not hold for these functional groups in this plant community; however, composition of the recipient community is a significant factor in community assembly."

A meta‐analysis spanning 203 species was conducted on published datasets from the northern hemisphere. Phenological response was examined with respect to two factors: distribution of species across latitudes and taxonomic affiliation or functional grouping of target species. Amphibians had a significantly stronger shift toward earlier breeding than all other taxonomic/functional groups, advancing more than twice as fast as trees, birds and butterflies. In turn, butterfly emergence or migratory arrival showed three times stronger advancement than the first flowering of herbs, perhaps portending increasing asynchrony in insect–plant interactions. Response was significantly stronger at higher latitudes where warming has been stronger, but latitude explained &lt; 4% of the variation. Despite expectation, latitude was not yet an important predictor of climate change impacts on phenology.

The scientific community has assumed this difference to be real and has attempted to explain it in terms of biologically relevant phenomena: specifically, differences in distribution of data across latitudes, taxa or time periods.

All analyses indicate that the difference in estimated response is primarily due to differences between the studies in criteria for incorporating data. It is a clear and automatic consequence of the exclusion by one study of data on ‘stable’ (nonresponsive) species.

Species with positive records in at least ten 10 km × 10 km grid squares (in the Finnish National Butterfly Recording Scheme, NAFI) in both periods were included in the study. When corrected for range size change, the 48 butterfly species had shifted their range margins northwards on average by 59.9 km between the study periods, with maximum shifts of over 300 km for three species. This rate of range shifts exceeds all previously reported records worldwide. Our findings may be explained by two factors: the study region is situated in higher latitudes than in most previous studies and it focuses on the period of most prominent warming during the last 10–15 years. Several species traits exhibited a significant univariate relationship with the range margin shift according to generalized estimation equations (GEE) taking into account the phylogenetic relatedness among species. Nonthreatened butterflies had on average expanded their ranges strongly northwards (84.5 km), whereas the distributions of threatened species were stationary (−2.1 km). Hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis indicated that mobile butterflies living in forest edges and using woody plants as their larval hosts exhibited largest range shifts towards the north.

However, most of these have been designed for entertainment rather than education. Hence, in this study we incorporate game elements into a learning environment. The My‐Mini‐Pet system is a handheld pet‐nurturing game environment, in which students learn with an animal learning companion, their My‐Mini‐Pet. Three design strategies are adopted. First, the pet‐nurturing strategy, which simulates the relationship between the pet and its owner, the My‐Mini‐Pet becomes a motivator/sustainer of learning. Second, the pet appearance‐changing strategy, which externalizes the learning status of the student. In other words, the My‐Mini‐Pet plays the role of a reflector. Third, the pet feedback strategy, which links the behaviours of the student and his/her pet, the My‐Mini‐Pet acts as a facilitator of learning. A pilot study was also conducted to preliminarily investigate the effectiveness and experiences of the strategies on allowing the student to understand arithmetic practices. The results showed that the strategy was effective, encouraging the students to engage in learning activities. Furthermore, the game attracted the students’ attention and stimulated discussion between peers. Some implications about the further developments are also discussed."

Still, experiments assessing effects of functional similarity have found contradictory results. <jats:bold>2.</jats:bold> We used experimental communities in a serpentine grassland in California, USA, to assess the extent to which functional composition and functional diversity influenced success of two different types of invading plants: early season annuals (E) and late‐season annuals (L) that have been previously shown to differ in patterns of resource acquisition. <jats:bold>3.</jats:bold> We seeded known quantities of seed of six different species (three in each functional group) into experimental plots containing established communities differing in functional composition and functional diversity. The experimental communities contained different combinations of E, L, perennial bunchgrass (P) and nitrogen‐fixer (N) functional groups, with functional diversity ranging from 0 to 4 groups. Each invading species was seeded into a separate quadrat within each plot to minimize competitive effects of invaders on each other. We measured both seedling and adult success of invaders for two full growing seasons to further understand mechanisms underlying biotic resistance. <jats:bold>4.</jats:bold> More functionally diverse communities were less invaded overall, as measured by the average success of individual invaders.

Environmental filters could constrain the number of successful ecological strategies in a habitat, resulting in similar suites of traits between native and successfully invading species (convergence). Conversely, concepts of limiting similarity and competitive exclusion predict native species will prevent invasion by functionally similar exotic species, resulting in trait divergence between the two species pools. Nutrient availability may further alter the strength of convergent or divergent forces in community assembly, by relaxing environmental constraints and/or influencing competitive interactions.<jats:bold>2.</jats:bold> To investigate how nutrient availability influences forces of divergence and convergence during the invasion of exotic species into native communities, we conducted multivariate analyses of community composition and functional traits from naturally assembled plant communities in long‐term nitrogen (N) addition experiments across North America.<jats:bold>3.</jats:bold> Relative abundances of key functional traits differed between the native and exotic plant communities, consistent with limiting similarity or a trait bias in the exotic species pool. Environmental context also played an important role in invasion because sites varied in the identity of the traits that predicted dissimilarity between native and exotic communities. Nitrogen enrichment did not alter these patterns.<jats:bold>4.</jats:bold> Nitrogen enrichment tended to increase exotic abundance, but this result was driven by a dramatic increase in exotics in only a few experiments. When similarity between native and exotic communities was included in the statistical model, N enrichment no longer predicted an increase in exotic relative abundance. Instead, sites with the highest abundance of exotic species were the ones where native and exotic communities had the highest trait similarity.<jats:bold>5.</jats:bold> <jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Our analysis of natural patterns of invasion across herbaceous communities in North America found evidence of both divergent and convergent forces on community assembly with exotic species.

Contrary to prior studies, invasion was not consistently promoted by N enrichment."

The immediate source of ants in Wuchuan appears to be somewhere near Texas, which ranks first among the southern USA infested states in the exportation of goods to China. Most colonies from spatially distant, outlying areas in China are genetically similar to one another and appear to share a common source (Wuchuan, Guangdong Province), suggesting that long‐distance jump dispersal has been a prevalent means of recent spread of fire ants in China.

Two microsatellite loci discriminated genotypes separated by the accumulation of few mutations (‘clone mates’) within each AFLP clone. Genetic diversity is partitioned mainly among apomictic populations and is not geographically structured, which may be due to facultative sexuality and/or multiple colonizations of sites by different clones. Habitat differentiation and a tendency to inhabit artificial meadows is more pronounced in apomictic than in sexual populations. We hypothesize that maintenance of genetic diversity and superior colonizing abilities of apomicts in temporally and spatially heterogeneous environments are important for their distributional success."

Casual and naturalized species have accumulated steadily and almost linearly over the past decades. Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae are the families with the most species.

Based on the results of electrocorticographic and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, it has been considered that human rolandic oscillations originate in the anterior bank of the central sulcus (20‐Hz rhythm) and the postcentral cortex (10‐Hz rhythm): the 20‐Hz oscillation is closely related to motor function, while the 10‐Hz rhythm is attributed mainly to sensory function. To test whether the rolandic oscillations are functionally relevant to the motor cortical excitability, we examined effects of 1‐Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left primary motor cortex (M1) on movement‐related changes of the rolandic oscillations in 12 normal subjects. MEG data recorded during brisk extension of the right index finger in two different sessions (with and without rTMS conditioning) were compared. Motor‐evoked potential (MEP) of the right hand muscle was also measured before and after rTMS to assess the motor cortical excitability. We found that 1‐Hz rTMS over M1 significantly reduced the movement‐related rebound of the 20‐Hz oscillation in association with decreased motor cortical excitability. In particular, movement‐related rebound of the 20‐Hz rhythm was closely tied with motor cortical excitability. These findings further strengthen the notion of functional relevance of 20‐Hz cortical oscillation to motor cortical excitability. In the framework of previous studies, the decrease in movement‐related rebound may be regarded as a compensatory reaction to the inhibited cortical activity."

We analysed the effects of conditioning rTMS on UFMs of different complexity (simple vs sequential finger movements), and performed with a different modality (internally vs externally paced movements). UFMs were monitored with a sensor‐engineered glove, and a quantitative evaluation of the following parameters was performed: touch duration (TD); inter‐tapping interval (ITI); timing error (TE); and number of errors (NE). 1‐Hz rTMS over ipsilateral M1 was able to affect the performance of a sequence of finger opposition movements in a metronome‐paced condition, significantly increasing TD and reducing ITI without TE changes. The effects on motor behaviour had a different magnitude as a function of the sequence complexity. Further, we found a different effect of the ipsilateral 1‐Hz rTMS on externally paced movements with respect to an internally paced condition. All these findings indicate that ipsilateral M1 plays an important role in the execution of sequential UFMs. Interestingly, NE did not change in any experimental condition, suggesting that ipsilateral M1 influences only the temporal and not the spatial accuracy of UFMs. Finally, the duration (up to 30 min) of 1‐Hz rTMS effects on ipsilateral M1 can indicate its direct action on the mechanisms of cortical plasticity, suggesting that rTMS can be used to modulate the communication between the two hemispheres in rehabilitative protocols."

In this system, the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) appears to play a causal role in the visual processing of tactile events. Whether this visuo‐tactile mechanism for touch in SI applies to the sight of ‘any’ touch, or whether it is restricted to the domain of body‐related tactile experiences remains unresolved. To address this issue, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to determine whether activity in SI is strictly related to the visual processing of human body‐part interactions, or is also involved in processing the contact between inanimate objects, or between human body‐parts and objects. The results show that rTMS over SI selectively impaired the processing of a contralateral visual stimulus depicting a human body‐part being touched by a human agent, while it did not affect the visual perception of contact between objects, or between human body‐parts and objects. Correlation analysis shows that this effect was associated with the intensity and embodiment of the observed touched. This result suggests that SI is more suited to represent social touch, contributing to our understanding of the effect of interpersonal tactile interactions between people."

We further show that species with native relatives were generally more successful in both countries, contrary to Darwin’s naturalization hypothesis, but this effect was inconsistent among families across the two countries.

This paper uses survey data from 683 teachers in 24 secondary schools across the UK to analyse the factors influencing how these benefits are being experienced. In particular, the paper explores the complex relationships between teachers' perceptions of technology‐related benefits and a range of individual, classroom, school and system‐level issues. A number of mediating issues and influences are identified and discussed throughout these analyses. In particular, it is suggested that teachers' perceptions of the benefits of using technology are influenced more by institutional rather than individual characteristics. A number of possible reasons are discussed, highlighting the importance of social and cultural contexts of digital technology use in education.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Practitioner Notes</jats:title>What is already known about this topic<jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item>So far, research on teachers' perceptions of the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has shown that while some teachers effortlessly “assimilate” and incorporate digital technologies into their teaching, and are more inclined to see the benefits of technology use in their classrooms, many others are often “blamed” for failing to see the “obvious” benefits of ICTs in the classroom.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Descriptions and analyses currently available therefore position particular groups and “types” of teachers as having rather uneasy relationships with technology, while at the same time representing technology use as the most rational and obvious choice for all teachers, irrespective of social and cultural differences.</jats:list-item>
</jats:list>What this paper adds<jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item>The paper argues that there is a need for more attention to be paid to how digital technologies are being used between different schools and, more problematically, to explore the relationship between teachers' perceptions and a range of individual and institutional factors.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>The paper attempts to move beyond the “discourses of deficiency” that characterise some schoolteachers as lacking individual attributes, capabilities and the required rational mindset to appreciate the “compelling potential” of ICTs.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>In particular, this paper explores in more detail the complex relationships between the benefits of technology use as perceived by schoolteachers and the various individual, classroom, school and system‐level issues that may underlie these perceptions. The findings suggest that broader contextual and cultural dimensions may mediate and significantly alter individual perceptions.</jats:list-item>
</jats:list>Implications for practice and/or policy<jats:list list-type=""explicit-label"">
<jats:list-item>This paper points to the need to develop a more rounded picture of the relationship(s) between the social contexts that surround schools, teachers and technology use. Indeed, there is arguably a need to move beyond “blaming” certain groups of teachers for not making best use of technology (ie, those who are older, female and so on).</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>As such, the data presented in this paper support the emerging argument to move beyond placing “dangerous moral imperatives” onto individual teachers to change their practices and processes in line with the assumed “affordances” of digital technology.</jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item>Individual teachers or whole schools could draw on the social shaping perspective and the findings presented in this paper to articulate a more critically minded set of responses in relation to digital technologies in their contexts, resisting individualising and blaming discourses that unfairly position them as the weak link in an otherwise linear, robust and unproblematic chain of deterministic assumptions.</jats:list-item>

Graph‐based motion synthesis methods such as motion graphs and move trees are popular ways to synthesize long motions by playing back a sequence of existing motion segments. However, motion graphs only support transitions between similar frames, and move trees only support transitions between the end of one motion segment and the start of another. In this paper, we introduce an optimization‐based graph that combines continuous constrained optimization with graph‐based motion synthesis. The constrained optimization is used to create a vast number of complex realistic‐looking transitions in the graph. The graph can then be used to synthesize long motions with non‐trivial transitions that for example allow the character to switch its behavior abruptly while retaining motion naturalness. We also propose to build this graph semi‐autonomously by requiring a user to classify generated transitions as acceptable or not and explicitly minimizing the amount of required classifications. This process guarantees the quality consistency of the optimization‐based graph at the cost of limited user involvement."

Although the main focus of this quantitative study is on the syntactic analysis of the data, some semantic aspects are also discussed. The results suggest that the Indian English way of placing focus particles in a clause‐final position could be a local innovation which has today spread to Singapore, Philippine and possibly to Hong Kong English. In addition, the data was analysed for all subcategories of ICE, which reveals that the frequencies for this use correlate positively with the level of informality of the speech situation in all four Asian varieties, whereas the results for British English suggest the opposite. Thus, the results indicate that clause‐final focus particles have acquired some additional uses, especially in spoken Indian English, and that these features have now spread to other English varieties spoken in Southeast Asia. The paper suggests that the cause for this can be found from the centuries‐old role that India has had as a cultural force in the Southeast Asian region."

The paper investigates the effect of the expansion on graduates’ early labour market attainment, focusing on overeducation. We define overeducation by combining occupation codes and a self-reported measure for the appropriateness of the match between qualification and the job. We therefore define three groups of graduates: matched, apparently overeducated and genuinely overeducated. This measure is well correlated with alternative definitions of overeducation. Comparing pre- and post-expansion cohorts of graduates, we find with this measure that the proportion of overeducated graduates has doubled, even though overeducation wage penalties have remained stable. We do not find that type of institution affects the probability of genuine overeducation. Apparently overeducated graduates are mostly indistinguishable from matched graduates, whereas genuinely overeducated graduates principally lack non-academic skills and suffer a large wage penalty. Individual unobserved heterogeneity differs between the three groups of graduates but controlling for it does not alter these conclusions."

Vegetation transects in this moderately sheep‐impacted sector show that a significant number of native and endemic herb and shrub species exhibit sympatric distribution patterns with introduced plants. Only one alien plant species has been recorded from any undisturbed and sheep‐free island sector so far.Socorro Island provides support for the hypothesis that disturbance of a pristine ecosystem is generally required for the colonization and naturalization of alien plants. Sheep are also indirectly responsible for the self‐invasion of mainland bird species into novel island habitats and for the decline and range contraction of several endemic bird species."

A baseline survey of native and NIS was undertaken in conjunction with a manipulative experiment to determine the effect that heavy metal pollution had on the diversity and invasibility of marine hard‐substrate assemblages. The study was repeated at two sites in each of two harbours in New South Wales, Australia. The survey sampled a total of 47 sessile invertebrate taxa, of which 15 (32%) were identified as native, 19 (40%) as NIS, and 13 (28%) as cryptogenic. Increasing pollution exposure decreased native species diversity at all study sites by between 33% and 50%. In contrast, there was no significant change in the numbers of NIS. Percentage cover was used as a measure of spatial dominance, with increased pollution exposure leading to increased NIS dominance across all sites. At three of the four study sites, assemblages that had previously been dominated by natives changed to become either extensively dominated by NIS or equally occupied by native and NIS alike. No single native or NIS was repeatedly responsible for the observed changes in native species diversity or NIS dominance at all sites. Rather, the observed effects of pollution were driven by a diverse range of taxa and species. These findings have important implications for both the way we assess pollution impacts, and for the management of NIS. When monitoring the response of assemblages to pollution, it is not sufficient to simply assess changes in community diversity. Rather, it is important to distinguish native from NIS components since both are expected to respond differently. In order to successfully manage current NIS, we first need to address levels of pollution within recipient systems in an effort to bolster the resilience of native communities to invasion."

Geographic range, body size and diet breadth were weakly correlated.<jats:bold>Main conclusions </jats:bold> The endemic small mammal fauna of northern Luzon includes species adapted to varying levels of natural disturbance and appears to be resistant to disruption by resident alien species. In these respects, it resembles a diverse continental fauna rather than a depauperate insular fauna. We conclude that the long and complex history of Luzon as an ancient member of the Philippine island arc system has involved highly dynamic ecological conditions resulting in a biota adapted to changing conditions. We predict that similar responses will be seen in other taxonomic groups and in other ancient island arc systems."

We used boosted regression trees to determine whether nine variables influence establishment success of introduced herpetofauna in California and Florida. We used an independent data set to assess model performance. Propagule pressure was the variable most strongly associated with establishment success. Species with short juvenile periods and species with phylogenetically more distant relatives in regional biotas were more likely to establish than species that start breeding later and those that have close relatives. Average climate match (the similarity of climate between native and non‐native range) and life form were also important. Frogs and lizards were the taxonomic groups most likely to establish, whereas a much lower proportion of snakes and turtles established. We used results from our best model to compile a spreadsheet‐based model for easy use and interpretation. Probability scores obtained from the spreadsheet model were strongly correlated with establishment success as were probabilities predicted for independent data by the boosted regression tree model. However, the error rate for predictions made with independent data was much higher than with cross validation using training data. This difference in predictive power does not preclude use of the model to assess the probability of establishment of herpetofauna because (1) the independent data had no information for two variables (meaning the full predictive capacity of the model could not be realized) and (2) the model structure is consistent with the recent literature on the primary determinants of establishment success for herpetofauna. It may still be difficult to predict the establishment probability of poorly studied taxa, but it is clear that non‐native species (especially lizards and frogs) that mature early and come from environments similar to that of the introduction region have the highest probability of establishment.</jats:italic>"

It serves as a cofactor in numerous transcription factors and enzyme systems including zinc‐dependent matrix metalloproteinases that augment autodebridement and keratinocyte migration during wound repair. Zinc confers resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins possibly through antioxidant activity of the cysteine‐rich metallothioneins. Zinc deficiency of hereditary or dietary cause can lead to pathological changes and delayed wound healing. Oral zinc supplementation may be beneficial in treating zinc‐deficient leg ulcer patients, but its therapeutic place in surgical patients needs further clarification. Topical administration of zinc appears to be superior to oral therapy due to its action in reducing superinfections and necrotic material via enhanced local defense systems and collagenolytic activity, and the sustained release of zinc ions that stimulates epithelialization of wounds in normozincemic individuals. Zinc oxide in paste bandages (Unna boot) protects and soothes inflamed peri‐ulcer skin. Zinc is transported through the skin from these formulations, although the systemic effects seem insignificant. We present here the first comprehensive account of zinc in wound management in relation to current concepts of wound bed preparation and the wound‐healing cascade. This review article suggests that topical zinc therapy is underappreciated even though clinical evidence emphasizes its importance in autodebridement, anti‐infective action, and promotion of epithelialization."

Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients."

Strong relatedness of invaders to native communities as an indication of niche overlap could promote naturalization because of appropriate niche adaptation, but could also hamper naturalization because of negative interactions with native species (‘Darwin's naturalization hypothesis’). Although these hypotheses provide clear and opposing predictions for expected patterns of species relatedness in invaded communities, so far no study has been able to clearly disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesize that conflicting past results are mainly due to the neglected role of spatial resolution of the community sampling. In this study, we corroborate both of Darwin's expectations by using phylogenetic relatedness as a measure of niche overlap and by testing the effects of sampling resolution in highly invaded coastal plant communities. At spatial resolutions fine enough to detect signatures of biotic interactions, we find that most invaders are less related to their nearest relative in invaded plant communities than expected by chance (phylogenetic overdispersion). Yet at coarser spatial resolutions, native assemblages become more invasible for closely‐related species as a consequence of habitat filtering (phylogenetic clustering). Recognition of the importance of the spatial resolution at which communities are studied allows apparently contrasting theoretical and empirical results to be reconciled. Our study opens new perspectives on how to better detect, differentiate and understand the impact of negative biotic interactions and habitat filtering on the ability of invaders to establish in native communities."

Conservation of mountain grasslands in Central Argentina,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R54782,Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"<jats:bold>Abstract. </jats:bold> Extensive areas in the mountain grasslands of central Argentina are heavily invaded by alien species from Europe. A decrease in biodiversity and a loss of palatable species is also observed. The invasibility of the tall‐grass mountain grassland community was investigated in an experiment of factorial design. Six alien species which are widely distributed in the region were sown in plots where soil disturbance, above‐ground biomass removal by cutting and burning were used as treatments. Alien species did not establish in undisturbed plots. All three types of disturbances increased the number and cover of alien species; the effects of soil disturbance and biomass removal was cumulative. <jats:italic>Cirsium vulgare</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Oenothera erythrosepala</jats:italic> were the most efficient alien colonizers. In conditions where disturbances did not continue the cover of aliens started to decrease in the second year, by the end of the third season, only a few adults were established. Consequently, disturbances are needed to maintain alien populations in tall‐grass mountain grasslands. Burning also increased the species richness of native species. We conclude that an efficient way to control the distribution of alien species is to decrease grazing pressure while burning as a traditional management tool may be continued."

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms facilitating this expansion are rarely known. We tested the hypothesis that dirt roads are favorable landing and nest initiation sites for founding‐queens of the leaf‐cutter ant <jats:italic>Atta laevigata</jats:italic>. For 2 yr, we compared the number of attempts to found new nests (colonization attempts) in dirt roads and the adjacent vegetation in a reserve of <jats:italic>cerrado</jats:italic> (tree‐dominated savanna) in southeastern Brazil. The number of colonization attempts in roads was 5 to 10 times greater than in the adjacent vegetation. Experimental transplants indicate that founding‐queens are more likely to establish a nest on bare soil than on soil covered with leaf‐litter, but the amount of litter covering the ground did not fully explain the preference of queens for dirt roads. Queens that landed on roads were at higher risk of predation by beetles and ants than those that landed in the adjacent vegetation. Nevertheless, greater predation in roads was not sufficient to offset the greater number of colonization attempts in this habitat. As a consequence, significantly more new colonies were established in roads than in the adjacent vegetation. Our results suggest that disturbance caused by the opening of roads could result in an increased <jats:italic>Atta</jats:italic> abundance in protected areas of the Brazilian Cerrado."

This arises, on the one hand, from their high ceramic content that ensures high strength of the material. On the other hand, various pathways are provided for stress dissipation, and thus toughness, due to their intricate hierarchical architectures. Such pathways include crack bridging, crack deflection, and delamination in the case of layered structures. On the basis of these inspiring ideas, we attempted here to create simultaneously strong and tough laminated alumina composite with high ceramic content. Composites were prepared from high‐grade commercial alumina with spin‐coated interlayers of ductile polymers (<jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PMMA</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">PVA</jats:styled-content>).

It is proposed that this increase may be attributed to an interlocking mechanism, often encountered in biological composites. The significance of sample architecture and the role of the interfacial and bulk properties of the interlayer material are discussed."

This is thought to indicate reduced biotic resistance, but recent theory predicts that phylogenetic relationships have more influence on competitive outcomes when interactions are more pair‐wise than diffuse. Therefore, phylogenetic relationships should change when the invader becomes dominant and interactions are more pair‐wise, rather than alter biotic resistance, which is the outcome of diffuse interactions with the resident community; however both processes can produce similar phylogenetic structures within communities.

 L.)",http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R111333,Botany,"Range and niche expansion are commonly associated with transitions to asexuality, polyploidy and hybridity (allopolyploidy) in plants. The ability of asexual polyploids to colonize novel habitats may be due to widespread generalist clones, multiple ecologically specialized clones, or may be a neutral by‐product of multiple, independent origins of asexual polyploids throughout the range. We have quantified niche size and divergence for hawthorns of the Pacific Northwest using data from herbarium vouchers with known cytotypes. We find that all polyploid niches diverge from that of the diploid range, and allopolyploids have the broadest niches. Allotetraploids have the largest niche and the widest geographic distribution. We then assessed the genetic mechanism of range expansion by surveying the ecological and geographic distribution of genotypes within each cytotype from sites in which fine‐scale habitat assessments were completed. We find no isolation by either geographic or ecological distance in allopolyploids, suggesting high dispersal and colonization ability. In contrast, autotriploids and diploids show patterns of isolation by geographic distance. We also compared the geographic and ecological distributions of clonal genotypes with those of randomly drawn sites of the most widespread cytotype. We found that most clones are geographically widespread and occur in a variety of habitats. We interpret these findings to suggest that patterns of range and niche expansion in Pacific Northwest Hawthorns may stem from these widespread, ecologically generalist clones of hybrid origin."

However, an experimental multi‐species test examining performance and herbivory of invasive alien, non‐invasive alien and native plant species in the presence and absence of natural enemies is lacking. In a common garden experiment in Switzerland, we manipulated exposure of seven alien invasive, eight alien non‐invasive and fourteen native species from six taxonomic groups to natural enemies (invertebrate herbivores), by applying a pesticide treatment under two different nutrient levels. We assessed biomass production, herbivore damage and the major herbivore taxa on plants. Across all species, plants gained significantly greater biomass under pesticide treatment. However, invasive, non‐invasive and native species did not differ in their biomass response to pesticide treatment at either nutrient level. The proportion of leaves damaged on invasive species was significantly lower compared to native species, but not when compared to non‐invasive species. However, the difference was lost when plant size was accounted for. There were no differences between invasive, non‐invasive and native species in herbivore abundance. Our study offers little support for invertebrate herbivore release as a driver of plant invasiveness, but suggests that future enemy release studies should account for differences in plant size among species."

Using a seed‐addition experiment, we studied effects of gastropods and rodents on recruitment success of 37 exotic and 37 native plant species affiliated to three different functional groups (i.e. grasses, legumes and non‐legume herbs). We replicated our seed addition x herbivore exclusion experiment at multiple grassland sites, located within a few km of each other in two regions, coastal central California (USA) and southern Saxony–Anhalt (Germany). The two study regions differed in climate, land‐use, invasion history and species pools which allowed us to disentangle general from context‐specific effects. In both regions, herbivory by gastropods had a stronger impact on the proportion of recruited seedlings and the proportion of recruited species than rodent herbivory, but this effect was much more pronounced in California than in Germany. Especially, seedling recruitment of non‐legume herbs and legumes suffered from gastropod herbivory. Contrastingly, the effect of rodents was negative at the German sites and positive at the Californian sites, likely driven by context‐specific differences in the rodent assemblages. Across both study regions, exotics had higher seedling recruitment than natives, indicating that higher recruitment success constitutes an inherent feature of exotic species. After two years, more exotic than native species established at grassland sites in California while the opposite was true for the German grassland sites. Consistently across regions, native and exotic species did, however, not differ in their response to herbivory, suggesting that generalist consumers suppress recruitment and colonization of plant species irrespective of their origin. Our results demonstrate the importance of a multi‐species, multi‐site approach to separate general responses of exotic and native plants to generalist herbivory from local, regional or species‐specific peculiarities."

In this study, we aim to make headway in understanding adaptive decision‐making in a dynamic interplay between changing situation, volatile information, and emerging coordination structures. Starting from theories of sensemaking, coordination, and decision‐making, we present two case studies that represent the response to two different humanitarian disasters: Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and the Syria Crisis, one of the most prominent ongoing conflicts. For both, we highlight how volatile information and the urge to respond via sensemaking lead to fragmentation and misalignment of emergent coordination structures and decisions, which, in turn, slow down adaptation. Based on the case studies, we derive propositions and the need to continuously align laterally between different regions and hierarchically between operational and strategic levels to avoid persistence of coordination‐information bubbles. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of methods and theory to ensure that humanitarian operations management captures the critical role of information as a driver of emergent coordination and adaptive decisions."

We compare initial establishment and first‐year performance of natives and the effectiveness of maintenance techniques in uniform versus mixed functional group plantings. We seeded ruderal herbaceous natives, longer‐lived shrubby natives, or a mixture of the two functional groups using drill‐ and hand‐seeding methods. Non‐natives were left undisturbed, removed by hand‐weeding and mowing, or treated with herbicide to test maintenance methods in a factorial design.

It presents a framework that could be used by decisionmakers (government and authorities) to structure budget allocation strategy toward different seismic risk mitigation measures, i.e., structural retrofitting for different building structural types in different locations and planning horizons. A two‐stage stochastic model is developed here to seek optimal mitigation measures based on minimizing mitigation expenditures, reconstruction expenditures, and especially large losses in highly seismically active countries. To consider fairness in the distribution of financial resources among different groups of people, the equity concept is incorporated using constraints in model formulation. These constraints limit inequity to the user‐defined level to achieve the equity‐efficiency tradeoff in the decision‐making process. To present practical application of the proposed model, it is applied to a pilot area in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. Building stocks, structural vulnerability functions, and regional seismic hazard characteristics are incorporated to compile a probabilistic seismic risk model for the pilot area. Results illustrate the variation of mitigation expenditures by location and structural type for buildings. These expenditures are sensitive to the amount of available budget and equity consideration for the constant risk aversion. Most significantly, equity is more easily achieved if the budget is unlimited. Conversely, increasing equity where the budget is limited decreases the efficiency. The risk‐return tradeoff, equity‐reconstruction expenditures tradeoff, and variation of per‐capita expected earthquake loss in different income classes are also presented."

The intensity of rTMS was above the threshold for inducing short latency interhemispherical inhibition with a single stimulus (equivalent to 115–120 % resting motor threshold). Before and after the rTMS we evaluated: (1) in the left hemisphere, the amplitude of motor‐evoked potentials (MEPs), and contralateral and ipsilateral cortical silent periods (CSP, ISP); (2) in the right hemisphere, MEP, CSP, ISP and short‐interval intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation (SICI/ICF), and (3) interhemispherical inhibition (IHI) from the left‐to‐right hemisphere using a paired‐pulse method. There were two main effects after rTMS to the left hemisphere: first, the amplitude of MEPs from the right hemisphere increased; second, there was a reduction in the IHI from the left‐to‐right hemisphere at interstimulus intervals of 7 and 10 ms but not at longer intervals (15–75 ms). Control experiments showed that these effects were not due to afferent inputs produced by the muscle twitches induced during the rTMS.

Here we describe two further similarities in TC and CTS control using (1) an I‐wave facilitation protocol and (2) preconditioning with rTMS. In experiment 1, excitability of TC pathways was measured using interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) and the ipsilateral silent period (iSP), whilst excitability of CTS pathways was measured by recording the EMG response evoked in the first dorsal interosseous muscle contralateral to the conditioning stimulus (cMEP). The intensity of the conditioning stimulus was first adjusted to threshold for evoking IHI and iSP, then pairs of conditioning stimuli were applied randomly at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) from 1.3 to 4.3 ms. IHI and iSP were facilitated at ISI = 1.5 ms and 3.0 ms, respectively, as was the MEP evoked by the conditioning stimuli in the contralateral hand. We suggest that TC projections receive I‐wave‐like facilitation similar to that seen in CTS projections. In experiment 2, short interval inhibition of the iSP (SICI<jats:sub>iSP</jats:sub>), and short interval intracortical inhibition of the cMEP (SICI<jats:sub>cMEP</jats:sub>) were examined before and after 600 pulses of 5 Hz rTMS at 90% resting motor threshold.

Based on experimental data for Re a 7000 and 30 deg ≤ β ≤ 60 deg, predictive correlations of the form Nu = C1,(β) D1(φ) Rep1(β)Pr1/3(μ/μw)0.14 and f = C2(β) D2(φ) Rep2(β) are devised. Finally, at constant pumping power, and depending upon Re, β, and φ, the heat transfer is found to be enhanced by up to 2.8 times that in an equivalent flat-plate channel."

               Industrial applications frequently pose a notorious challenge for state-of-the-art methods in the contexts of optimization, designing experiments and modeling unknown physical response. This problem is aggravated by limited availability of clean data, uncertainty in available physics-based models and additional logistic and computational expense associated with experiments. In such a scenario, Bayesian methods have played an impactful role in alleviating the aforementioned obstacles by quantifying uncertainty of different types under limited resources. These methods, usually deployed as a framework, allows decision makers to make informed choices under uncertainty while being able to incorporate information on the fly, usually in the form of data, from multiple sources while being consistent with the physical intuition about the problem. This is a major advantage that Bayesian methods bring to fruition especially in the industrial context. This paper is a compendium of the Bayesian modeling methodology that is being consistently developed at GE Research. The methodology, called GE's Bayesian hybrid modeling (GEBHM), is a probabilistic modeling method, based on the Kennedy and O'Hagan framework, that has been continuously scaled-up and industrialized over several years. In this work, we explain the various advancements in GEBHM's methods and demonstrate their impact on several challenging industrial problems."

               In order to meet user expectations and to optimize user experience with a higher degree of flexibility and sustainability, the Smart product–service system (Smart PSS), as a novel value proposition paradigm considering both online and offline smartness, was proposed. However, conventional manners for developing PSS require many professional consultations and still cannot meet with the new features of Smart PSS, such as user context-awareness and ever-evolving knowledge management. Therefore, aiming to assist Smart PSS development cost-effectively, this paper adopted the knowledge graph (KG) technique and concept–knowledge (C-K) model to propose an evolutionary design approach. Two knowledge graphs are firstly established with open-source knowledge, prototype specifications, and user-generated textual data. Then, triggered by personalized requirements, four KG-aided C-K operators are conducted based on graph-based query patterns and computational linguistics algorithms, thus generating innovative solutions for evolving Smart PSS. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, a case study of a smart nursing bed fulfilling multiple personalized requirements is conducted, and the evaluation result of its knowledge evolution is acceptable. It hopes that this work can offer insightful guidance to industrial organizations in their development of Smart PSS."

               This paper concerns the design and rigorous in silico evaluation of a closed-loop hemorrhage resuscitation algorithm with blood pressure (BP) as controlled variable. A lumped-parameter control design model relating volume resuscitation input to blood volume (BV) and BP responses was developed and experimentally validated. Then, three alternative adaptive control algorithms were developed using the control design model: (i) model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with BP feedback, (ii) composite adaptive control (CAC) with BP feedback, and (iii) CAC with BV and BP feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate model-based control design for hemorrhage resuscitation with readily available BP as feedback. The efficacy of these closed-loop control algorithms was comparatively evaluated as well as compared with an empiric expert knowledge-based algorithm based on 100 realistic virtual patients created using a well-established physiological model of cardiovascular (CV) hemodynamics. The in silico evaluation results suggested that the adaptive control algorithms outperformed the knowledge-based algorithm in terms of both accuracy and robustness in BP set point tracking: the average median performance error (MDPE) and median absolute performance error (MDAPE) were significantly smaller by &amp;gt;99% and &amp;gt;91%, and as well, their interindividual variability was significantly smaller by &amp;gt;88% and &amp;gt;94%.

               As analysts still grapple with understanding core damage accident progression at Three Mile Island and Fukushima that caught the nuclear industry off-guard once too many times, one notices the very limited detail with which the large reactor cores of these subject reactors have been modelled in their severe accident simulation code packages. At the same time, modelling of CANDU severe accidents have largely borrowed from and suffered from the limitations of the same LWR codes (see IAEA TECDOC 1727) whose applications to PHWRs have poorly caught critical PHWR design specifics and vulnerabilities. As a result, accident management measures that have been instituted at CANDU PHWRs, while meeting the important industry objective of publically seeming to be doing something about lessons learnt from say Fukushima and showing that the reactor designs are oh so close to perfect and the off-site consequences of severe accidents happily benign.
               Integrated PHWR severe accident progression and consequence assessment code ROSHNI can make a significant contribution to actual, practical understanding of severe accident progression in CANDU PHWRs, improving significantly on the other PHWR specific computer codes developed three decades ago when modeling decisions were constrained by limited computing power and poor understanding of and interest in severe core damage accidents. These codes force gross simplifications in reactor core modelling and do not adequately represent all the right CANDU core details, materials, fluids, vessels or phenomena. But they produce results that are familiar and palatable. They do, however to their credit, also excel in their computational speed, largely because they model and compute so little and with such un-necessary simplifications.
               ROSHNI sheds most previous modelling simplifications and represents each of the 380 channels, 4560 bundle, 37 elements in four concentric ring, Zircaloy clad fuel geometry, materials and fluids more faithfully in a 2000 MW(Th) CANDU6 reactor. It can be used easily for other PHWRs with different number of fuel channels and bundles per each channel. Each of horizontal PHWR reactor channels with all their bundles, fuel rings, sheaths, appendages, end fittings and feeders are modelled and in detail that reflects large across core differences. While other codes model at best a few hundred core fuel entities, thermo-chemical transient behaviour of about 73,000 different fuel channel entities within the core is considered by ROSHNI simultaneously along with other 15,000 or so other flow path segments. At each location all known thermo-chemical and hydraulic phenomena are computed. With such detail, ROSHNI is able to provide information on their progressive and parallel thermo-chemical contribution to accident progression and a more realistic fission product release source term that would belie the miniscule one (100 TBq of Cs-137 or 0.15% of core inventory) used by EMOs now in Canada on recommendation of our national regulator CNSC. ROSHNI has an advanced, more CANDU specific consideration of each bundle transitioning to a solid debris behaviour in the Calandria vessel without reverting to a simplified molten corium formulation that happily ignores interaction of debris with vessel welds, further vessel failures and energetic interactions. The code is able to follow behaviour of each fuel bundle following its disassembly from the fuel channel and thus demonstrate that the gross assumption of a core collapse made in some analyses is wrong and misleading. It is able to thus demonstrate that PHWR core disassembly is not only gradual, it will be also be incomplete with a large number of low power, peripheral fuel channels never disassembling under most credible scenarios.
               The code is designed to grow into and use its voluminous results in a severe accident simulator for operator training. It’s phenomenological models are able to examine design inadequacies / issues that affect accident progression and several simple to implement design improvements that have a profound effect on results. For example, an early pressure boundary failure due to inadequacy of heat sinks in a station blackout scenario can be examined along with the effect of improved and adequate over pressure protection.
               A best effort code such as ROSHNI can be instrumental in identifying the risk reduction benefits of undertaking certain design, operational and accidental management improvements for PHWRs, with some of the multi-unit ones handicapped by poor pressurizer placement and leaky containments with vulnerable materials, poor overpressure protection, ad-hoc mitigation measures and limited instrumentation common to all CANDUs. Case in point is the PSA supported design and installed number of Hydrogen recombiners that are neither for the right gas (designed mysteriously for H2 instead of D2) or its potential release quantity (they are sparse and will cause explosions).
               The paper presents ROSHNI results of simulations of a postulated station blackout scenario and sheds a light on the challenges ahead in minimizing risk from operation of these otherwise unique power reactors."

Our emphasis is on photons with energies greater than 8.8 eV, which have enough energy to damage SiO2. These discharges were in an inductively driven Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) reference cell which had been modified to more closely resemble commercial etching tools. Comparisons of measurements made through a side port in the cell and through a hole in the wafer indicate that the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light in these discharges is strongly trapped. For the pure halocarbon gases examined in these experiments (C2F6, CHF3, C4F8), the fluxes of VUV photons to the wafer varied from 1 to 3×1015 photons/cm2 s or equivalently from 1.5 to 5 mW/cm2. These measurements imply that 0.1%–0.3% of the rf source power to these discharges ends up hitting the wafer as VUV photons for our typical 20 mT, 200 W rf discharges. For typical “ashing” discharges containing pure oxygen, the VUV intensities are slightly higher—about 8 mW/cm2. As argon or hydrogen diluents are added to the fluorocarbon gases, the VUV intensities increase dramatically, with a 10/10/10 mixture of Ar/C2F6/H2 yielding VUV fluxes on the wafer 26 mW/cm2 and pure argon discharges yielding 52 mW/cm2. Adding a rf bias to the wafer had only a small effect on the VUV observed through a side port of the GEC cell."

The highly energetic photons can induce surface damage by driving surface reactions, disordering surface regions, and affecting bonds in the bulk material. In argon plasmas, the VUV emissions are due to the decay of the 1s4 and 1s2 principal resonance levels with emission wavelengths of 104.8 and 106.7 nm, respectively. The authors have measured the number densities of atoms in the two resonance levels using both white light optical absorption spectroscopy and radiation-trapping induced changes in the 3p54p→3p54s branching fractions measured via visible/near-infrared optical emission spectroscopy in an argon inductively coupled plasma as a function of both pressure and power. An emission model that takes into account radiation trapping was used to calculate the VUV emission rate. The model results were compared to experimental measurements made with a National Institute of Standards and Technology-calibrated VUV photodiode. The photodiode and model results are in generally good accord and reveal a strong dependence on the neutral gas temperature."

Depending on their wavelength, VUV photons can easily transmit thin upper dielectric layers and affect the electrical characteristics of the devices. Despite their importance, measuring VUV fluxes is complicated by the fact that few materials transmit at VUV wavelengths, and both detectors and windows are easily damaged by plasma exposure. The authors have previously reported on measuring VUV fluxes in pure argon plasmas by monitoring the concentrations of Ar(3p54s) resonance atoms that produce the VUV emissions using noninvasive optical emission spectroscopy in the visible/near-infrared wavelength range [Boffard et al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol., A 32, 021304 (2014)]. Here, the authors extend this technique to other rare-gases (Ne, Kr, and Xe) and argon-molecular gas plasmas (Ar/H2, Ar/O2, and Ar/N2). Results of a model for VUV emissions that couples radiation trapping and the measured rare-gas resonance level densities are compared to measurements made with both a calibrated VUV photodiode and a sodium salicylate fluorescence detection scheme. In these more complicated gas mixtures, VUV emissions from a variety of sources beyond the principal resonance levels of the rare gases are found to contribute to the total VUV flux."

In a standard aluminum etching mixture containing Cl2 and BCl3 almost all the light emitted at energies exceeding 8.8 eV was due to neutral atomic chlorine. Optical trapping of the VUV radiation in the discharge complicates calculations of VUV fluxes to the wafer. However, we measured total photon fluxes to the wafer at energies above 8.8 eV on the order of 4×1014 photons/cm2 s with a nonreactive wafer and 0.7×1014 photons/cm2 s with a reactive wafer. The majority of the radiation was between 8.9 and 9.3 eV. At these energies, the photons have enough energy to create electron-hole pairs in SiO2 and may penetrate up to a micron into the SiO2 before being absorbed. Relevance of these measurements to VUV photon-induced damage of SiO2 during etching is discussed."

A questionnaire, which included items on overall quality and its single aspects such as acoustical, thermal, indoor air and visual quality, has been administered to 1006 students. The students perceived that acoustical and visual quality had the most influence on their school performance and, with the same dissatisfaction for acoustical, thermal and indoor air quality, they attributed more relevance, in the overall quality judgment, to the acoustical condition. Acoustical quality was correlated to speech comprehension, which was correlated to the speech transmission index, even though the index does not reflect all the aspects by which speech comprehension can be influenced. Acoustical satisfaction was lower in nonrenovated classrooms, and one of the most important consequences of poor acoustics was a decrease in concentration.

            Surface waters of the subtropical Sargasso Sea contain dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations of 0.2 to 1.0 nanomolar, which are sufficiently low to result in phosphorus control of primary production. The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic.

            Many of the materials that animals use to make shells and skeletons are built with brittle or soft molecules. They owe their amazing mechanical properties to their layered construction, which is a challenge for synthetic fabrication. Pearly nacre, for example, has proved challenging to make owing to its complex structure of aragonite crystals in an organic matrix. Using an assembly-and-mineralization approach, Mao

However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RATIONALE</jats:title>To address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>The base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from ~32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; ~79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and ~2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising ~238,000 linkage-disequilibrium–independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that &gt;88% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a ~6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a ~3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses.</jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSION</jats:title>Our resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders.

Toward the end of June 2020, 68% of mink farm workers tested positive for the virus or had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. These large clusters of infection were initiated by human COVID-19 cases with viruses that bear the D614G mutation. Sequencing has subsequently shown that mink-to-human transmission also occurred. More work must be done to understand whether there is a risk that mustelids may become a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.

The higher the antibody level, the greater the protection afforded by the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine.

The evaluable database included 107 acutely ill patients, 128 pathogens, and five antimicrobial regimens. Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics were characterized by using serum concentrations, and culture and sensitivity tests were performed daily on tracheal aspirates to examine resistance. Pharmacodynamic (PD) models were developed to identify factors associated with the probability of developing bacterial resistance. Overall, in 32 of 128 (25%) initially susceptible cases resistance developed during therapy.

          The objective of this study was to determine whether chitosan (poly-β-1,4-glucosamine) and hydrolysates of chitosan can be used as novel preservatives in foods. Chitosan was hydrolyzed by using oxidative-reductive degradation, crude papaya latex, and lysozyme. Mild hydrolysis of chitosan resulted in improved microbial inactivation in saline and greater inhibition of growth of several spoilage yeasts in laboratory media, but highly degraded products of chitosan exhibited no antimicrobial activity. In pasteurized apple-elderflower juice stored at 7°C, addition of 0.3 g of chitosan per liter eliminated yeasts entirely for the duration of the experiment (13 days), while the total counts and the lactic acid bacterial counts increased at a slower rate than they increased in the control. Addition of 0.3 or 1.0 g of chitosan per kg had no effect on the microbial flora of houmous, a chickpea dip; in the presence of 5.0 g of chitosan per kg, bacterial growth but not yeast growth was substantially reduced compared with growth in control dip stored at 7°C for 6 days. Improved antimicrobial potency of chitosan hydrolysates like that observed in the saline and laboratory medium experiments was not observed in juice and dip experiments. We concluded that native chitosan has potential for use as a preservative in certain types of food but that the increase in antimicrobial activity that occurs following partial hydrolysis is too small to justify the extra processing involved."

These two toxins, TcdA and TcdB, are encoded on a pathogenicity locus along with negative and positive regulators of their expression. Following expression and release from the bacterium, TcdA and TcdB translocate to the cytosol of target cells and inactivate small GTP-binding proteins, which include Rho, Rac, and Cdc42. Inactivation of these substrates occurs through monoglucosylation of a single reactive threonine, which lies within the effector-binding loop and coordinates a divalent cation critical to binding GTP. By glucosylating small GTPases, TcdA and TcdB cause actin condensation and cell rounding, which is followed by death of the cell. TcdA elicits effects primarily within the intestinal epithelium, while TcdB has a broader cell tropism. Important advances in the study of these toxins have been made in the past 15 years, and these are detailed in this review. The domains, subdomains, and residues of these toxins important for receptor binding and enzymatic activity have been elegantly studied and are highlighted herein. Furthermore, there have been major advances in defining the role of these toxins in modulating the inflammatory events involving the disruption of cell junctions, neuronal activation, cytokine production, and infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells.

Immunol. 11:50-55, 2004). Both these methods are laboratory based. We describe the development of a rapid lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) test kit for the measurement of anti-PA IgG in serum or whole-blood samples (30-μl samples) using colloidal gold nanoparticles as the detection reagent and an internal control. Using sera from 19 anthrax AVA vaccinees (anti-PA IgG range, 2.4 to 340 μg/ml) and 10 controls and PA-supplemented whole-blood samples, we demonstrated that the LFIA had a sensitivity of approximately 3 μg/ml anti-PA IgG in serum and ∼14 μg/ml anti-PA IgG in whole blood. Preabsorption of sera with PA yielded negative anti-PA LFIAs. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% using ELISA-measured anti-PA IgG as the standard. This kit has utility in determining anti-PA antibody reactivity in the sera of individuals vaccinated with AVA or individuals with clinical anthrax.

            ), raising concerns about potential zoonotic infections. With 31% of United Kingdom households owning a dog, this could prove to be an important transmission route. To examine this risk, canine tissues were studied for their ability to bind to HuNoV
            <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>
            . In addition, canine stool samples were analyzed for the presence of viral nucleic acid, and canine serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-HuNoV antibodies. The results showed that seven different genotypes of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) can bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue, suggesting that infection is at least theoretically possible. Although HuNoV RNA was not identified in stool samples from 248 dogs, serological evidence of previous exposure to HuNoV was obtained in 43/325 canine serum samples. Remarkably, canine seroprevalence for different HuNoV genotypes mirrored the seroprevalence in the human population. Though entry and replication within cells have not been demonstrated, the canine serological data indicate that dogs produce an immune response to HuNoV, implying productive infection. In conclusion, this study reveals zoonotic implications for HuNoV, and to elucidate the significance of this finding, further epidemiological and molecular investigations will be essential.

            Norovirus and rotavirus are the two most important causes of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Both norovirus and rotavirus recognize human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), and multiple binding patterns for HBGAs have been reported. To explore the role of HBGAs in host susceptibility to norovirus and rotavirus, we conducted a cross-sectional study in children hospitalized with diarrhea in northern Vietnam from September 2010 through September 2012.

Of the 28 GII.3 cases, 12 involved HBGA secretors, 11 partial secretors, and 5 nonsecretors. A total of 85 children tested positive for rotavirus, 74 of whom were infected with genotype P[8], 5 with P[4], and 6 with P[6]; all were HBGA secretors or partial secretors. This is the first epidemiological study demonstrating in a population that HBGA phenotype is a key susceptibility factor for both norovirus and rotavirus infections in children.

The possibility that strain AU-1 was a laboratory contaminant of an animal rotavirus previously adapted to tissue culture cells was ruled out, and the identity of the AU-1 strain was established. Genetic analysis by RNA-RNA hybridization revealed that the AU-1 strain is not a simple reassortant between subgroup I and II human rotaviruses but that it shares a high level of sequence homology only with the gene encoding VP7 (the major neutralization protein) of serotype 3 human rotaviruses. Weak homology of the genomic RNA segments was also observed between the AU-1 strain and animal rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus strain RRV and bovine rotavirus strain NCDV.

Following successful adaptation to growth in cell cultures, the serotype 3 strains (MZ58, PCP5, and PA710) were further characterized by neutralization and by RNA-RNA (Northern blot) hybridization. Antiserum to reference HRV strain YO (subgroup II, serotype 3), as well as a monoclonal antibody to VP7 of YO neutralized, at comparable titers, the homologous virus, the three unusual HRV strains, and two reference simian strains (SA11 and RRV-2, both subgroup I, serotype 3), whereas SA11 antiserum and a monoclonal antibody to VP7 of SA11 neutralized simian strains more efficiently. However, antiserum to PCP5 neutralized the three unusual isolates and the simian strains at significantly higher titers than it did with reference strain YO. With 32P-labeled RNA from MZ58 as a probe, a high degree of homology was detected by Northern blot hybridization with strains PCP5, PA710, SA11, and UK (bovine rotavirus) at the level of several segments and with strain YO only at the level of genes 7 to 9. Conversely, labeled RNA of strain YO hybridized extensively with Wa (subgroup II, serotype 1 HRV strain) but only at the level of genes 7 to 9 with MZ58, PCP5, PA710, SA11, and UK. Finally, the labeled SA11 probe hybridized at the level of RNA segments 1 to 3 and 6 to 11 to the three unusual strains. These findings suggest that the unusual subgroup I, serotype 3, strains isolated from humans are more likely to be animal rotaviruses rather than natural reassortants between different HRV strains."

All serum samples from the patients who were confirmed to be positive for leptospirosis by either a positive microscopic agglutination test or a positive culture but were found to be negative by the dipstick assay were also judged to be negative by the IgM ELISA or revealed borderline titers by the IgM ELISA.

A specificity of ca. 90% was shown in a group of schistosome-negative schoolchildren from Tarime, Tanzania, an area where schistosomiasis is not endemic. The test is easy to perform and requires no technical equipment or special training. The stability of the strips and the conjugate in the dry format lasts for at least 3 months at ambient temperature in sealed packages, making it suitable for transport and use in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic. This assay can easily be developed to an end-user format.

In this study we characterized antibody prevalence among domestic pigs by using recombinant capsid antigens of two human NVs (Norwalk and Hawaii) and one swine NV (SW918) that is genetically related to GII human NVs. Recombinant SW918 capsid protein expressed in baculovirus self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) that were detected by antibodies against GII (Hawaii and Mexico), but not GI (Norwalk and VA115), human NVs. NVs recognize human histo-blood group antigens as receptors, but SW918 VLPs did not bind to human saliva samples with major histo-blood group types. Seventy-eight of 110 (71%) pig serum samples from the United States and 95 of 266 (36%) pig serum samples from Japan possessed antibodies against SW918. Serum samples from pigs in the United States were also tested for antibodies against human NVs; 63% were positive for Norwalk virus (GI) and 52% for Hawaii virus (GII). These results indicate that NV infections are common among domestic pigs; the finding of antigenic relationships between SW918 and human NVs and the detection of antibodies against both GI and GII human NVs in domestic animals highlights the importance of further studies on NV gastroenteritis as a possible zoonotic disease."

Fifty-seven (11%) samples contained recovirus isolates. In addition, one NoV was detected. Phylogenetic analysis classified the recovirus isolates into two genogroups and at least four genetic types. The rhesus NoV isolate was closely related to GII human NoVs. TV-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 88% of serum samples obtained from primate caretakers. Binding and plaque reduction assays revealed the involvement of type A and B histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) in TV infection.

Expression of structural and nonstructural proteins was detected in cells with macrophage-like morphology in the spleens and livers of BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice, confirming the ability of HuNoV to replicate in a mouse model. In summary, HuNoV replication in BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice is dependent on the immune-deficient status of the host but not on the presence of human immune cells and provides the first genetically manipulable small-animal model for studying HuNoV infection.

            Human noroviruses are a significant cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Antivirals and vaccines are currently not available, in part due to the inability to study these viruses in a genetically manipulable, small-animal model. Herein, we report the first mouse model for human noroviruses. This model will accelerate our understanding of human norovirus biology and provide a useful resource for evaluating antiviral therapies.

Despite this, few reports describe natural infections in animals or directly link them to human infections using genomic data. In the present study, we describe the first cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in tigers and lions in the United States and provide epidemiological and genetic evidence for human-to-animal transmission of the virus. Our data show that tigers and lions were infected with different genotypes of SARS-CoV-2, indicating two independent transmission events to the animals. Importantly, infected animals shed infectious virus in respiratory secretions and feces. A better understanding of the susceptibility of animal species to SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate transmission mechanisms and identify potential reservoirs and sources of infection that are important in both animal and human health."

               The South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin, located between the South Pole and Aitken crater on the far side of the Moon, is the largest confirmed lunar impact structure. The pre-Nectarian SPA basin is a 2400 × 2050 km elliptical structure centered at 53°S, 191°E, which should have exposed lower crust and upper mantle due to the enormous excavation depth. Olivine, the dominant mineral in Earth’s mantle, has only been identified in small and localized exposures in the margins of the SPA basin, and the dominant mafic component is, instead, pyroxene. These mineralogical characteristics could be explained by the recent hypothesis that the lunar upper mantle is dominated by low-calcium pyroxene, not olivine. Here, we present observations from imaging and spectral data from China’s Chang’E-4 (CE-4) lunar mission in the first 4 synodic days, especially the first in situ visible/near-infrared spectrometer observations of an exposed boulder. We identified a variety of rock types, but not the recently reported olivine-rich materials in the landing region. The results are consistent with orbital observations. The obtained mineralogical information provides a better understanding of the nature and origin of SPA materials."

Using this reference standard, 22 systems were developed for concept extraction, 21 for assertion classification, and 16 for relation classification.
               These systems showed that machine learning approaches could be augmented with rule-based systems to determine concepts, assertions, and relations. Depending on the task, the rule-based systems can either provide input for machine learning or post-process the output of machine learning.

            The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community.

            The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.

The first KPI measures country IDSR performance and the second KPI tracks the number of countries that the WHO secretariat supports to scale up IDSR. The KPI data for 2017 were compared with a retrospective baseline for 2014.By December 2017, 44 of 47 African countries (94%) were implementing IDSR.

We monitored damage experienced by S. virgaurea planted into communities with native congeners and without close relatives. Community type was crossed with a vegetation removal treatment to assess the combined effects of herbivory and competition on survival. We also evaluated growth of S. virgaurea in a greenhouse experiment where seedlings were exposed to soil biota sampled from these communities and compared with sterile controls. Overall, community type did not affect levels of herbivory or plant survival. Removal of surrounding vegetation resulted in reduced damage and increased survival; these effects were largest in grass-dominated communities. Soil sterilization reduced root growth and tended to reduce shoot growth, especially when compared with plants inoculated with biota collected near congeners. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of close relatives is unlikely to make old-field communities more resistant to invasion by S. virgaurea; instead, soil biota might facilitate growth in communities dominated by close relatives.

We performed an architectural analysis to gain an understanding of the structural and ontogenic properties of common buckthorn ( Rhamnus cathartica L., Rhamnaceae) growing in the understory and under an open canopy. We found that ontogenic effects on growth need to be calibrated if a full description of phenotypic plasticity is to be obtained. Our analysis pointed to three levels of organization (or nested structural units) in R. cathartica. Their modulation in relation to light conditions leads to the expression of two architectural strategies that involve sets of traits known to confer competitive advantage in their respective environments. In the understory, the plant develops a tree-like form. Its strategy here is based on restricting investment in exploitation structures while promoting major vertical exploration and is probably key to species survival in the understory. Under an open canopy, the second strategy leads the plant to adopt a shrub-like shape. It develops densely branched exploitation structures and flowers abundantly and rapidly. This strategy perfectly matches its aggressive behaviour observed in full sunlight. We propose, as hypotheses, that these two light-related strategies are implicated in the ability of R. cathartica to outcompete the surrounding vegetation in a range of environmental conditions."

In the 3 years studied, steelhead spawning occurred from mid March through May and resident rainbow trout spawning occurred from mid March through August. The timing of 50% spawning was 9-10 weeks earlier for steelhead than for resident rainbow trout. Spawning sites selected by steelhead were in deeper water and had larger substrate than those selected by resident rainbow trout. Maternal origin was identified by comparing Sr/Ca ratios in the primordia and freshwater growth regions of the otolith with a wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe. In the Deschutes River, only steelhead of steelhead maternal origin and resident rainbow trout of resident rainbow trout origin were observed. In the Babine River, steelhead of resident rainbow trout origin and resident rainbow trout of steelhead maternal origin were also observed.

The replicated experiment included three treatments: vegetation control with five annual herbicide applications superimposed over two levels of slash removal (bole only or total tree plus most other wood) and an untreated control. Three species groups were analyzed: native forest, native ruderals, and exotic ruderals. Without vegetation control, the understory was rapidly invaded by exotic ruderals but was codominated by native and exotic ruderals by year 6. Douglas-fir cover surpassed covers in the three species group covers at least 3 years sooner with herbicide treatments than without. Species richness and coverage were lower for all species groups with vegetation control than without vegetation control. The effects of organic matter removal were much less than that of vegetation control.

GraphQL was proposed to reduce the number of queries and data exchanged in comparison with REST. Since its release in 2015, it has gained momentum as an alternative approach to REST. However, generating and maintaining GraphQL resolvers is not a simple task. First, a domain expert has to analyze a dataset, design the corresponding GraphQL schema and map the dataset to the schema. Then, a software engineer (e.g. GraphQL developer) implements the corresponding GraphQL resolvers in a specific programming language. In this paper, we present an approach to exploit the information from mappings rules (relation between target and source schema) and generate a GraphQL server. These mapping rules construct a virtual knowledge graph which is accessed by the generated GraphQL resolvers. These resolvers translate the input GraphQL queries into the queries supported by the underlying dataset. Domain experts or software developers may benefit from our approach: a domain expert does not need to involve software developers to implement the resolvers, and software developers can generate the initial version of the resolvers to be implemented. We implemented our approach in the Morph-GraphQL framework and evaluated it using the LinGBM benchmark. "

A significant amount of this clinical data is expressed within the narrative portion of the EMRs, requiring natural language processing techniques to unlock the medical knowledge referred to by physicians. This knowledge, derived from the practice of medical care, complements medical knowledge already encoded in various structured biomedical ontologies. Moreover, the clinical knowledge derived from EMRs also exhibits relational information between medical concepts, derived from the cohesion property of clinical text, which is an attractive attribute that is currently missing from the vast biomedical knowledge bases. In this paper, we describe an automatic method of generating a graph of clinically related medical concepts by considering the belief values associated with those concepts. The belief value is an expression of the clinician's assertion that the concept is qualified as present, absent, suggested, hypothetical, ongoing, etc. Because the method detailed in this paper takes into account the hedging used by physicians when authoring EMRs, the resulting graph encodes qualified medical knowledge wherein each medical concept has an associated assertion (or belief value) and such qualified medical concepts are spanned by relations of different strengths, derived from the clinical contexts in which concepts are used. In this paper, we discuss the construction of a qualified medical knowledge graph (QMKG) and treat it as a BigData problem addressed by using MapReduce for deriving the weighted edges of the graph.

The parameters of the model are all learned automatically; no manual tuning is required for the learning component of the system. We additionally describe a novel procedure for interpolating between styles.Our style-based IK can replace conventional IK, wherever it is used in computer animation and computer vision. We demonstrate our system in the context of a number of applications: interactive character posing, trajectory keyframing, real-time motion capture with missing markers, and posing from a 2D image."

One essential component of these tasks is the ability to predict routes in the Internet. However, the Internet is composed of a large number of independent autonomous systems (ASes) resulting in complex interactions, and until now no model of the Internet has succeeded in producing predictions of acceptable accuracy.We demonstrate that there are two limitations of prior models: (i) they have all assumed that an Autonomous System (AS) is an atomic structure - it is not, and (ii) models have tended to oversimplify the relationships between ASes. Our approach uses multiple quasi-routers to capture route diversity within the ASes, and is deliberately agnostic regarding the types of relationships between ASes. The resulting model ensures that its routing is consistent with the observed routes. Exploiting a large number of observation points, we show that our model provides accurate predictions for unobserved routes, a first step towards developing structural mod-els of the Internet that enable real applications."

It also achieves more equitable bandwidth allocations among flows with different RTTs (round trip times) by making the window growth to be independent of RTT -- thus those flows grow their congestion window at the same rate. During steady state, CUBIC increases the window size aggressively when the window is far from the saturation point, and the slowly when it is close to the saturation point. This feature allows CUBIC to be very scalable when the bandwidth and delay product of the network is large, and at the same time, be highly stable and also fair to standard TCP flows.

          It is both theoretically and empirically shown that the main memory usage of DOLPHIN amounts to a small fraction of the dataset and that DOLPHIN has linear time performance with respect to the dataset size. DOLPHIN gains efficiency by naturally merging together in a unified schema three strategies, namely the selection policy of objects to be maintained in main memory, usage of pruning rules, and similarity search techniques. Importantly, similarity search is accomplished by the algorithm without the need of preliminarily indexing the whole dataset, as other methods do.
          The algorithm is simple to implement and it can be used with any type of data, belonging to either metric or nonmetric spaces. Moreover, a modification to the basic method allows DOLPHIN to deal with the scenario in which the available buffer of main memory is smaller than its standard requirements. DOLPHIN has been compared with state-of-the-art distance-based outlier detection algorithms, showing that it is much more efficient."

We focus on the class of well-designed SPARQL queries, which has been proposed in the literature as a fragment of the language with good properties regarding query evaluation. We first propose a tree representation for SPARQL queries, called pattern trees, which captures the class of well-designed SPARQL graph patterns. Among other results, we propose several rules that can be used to transform pattern trees into a simple normal form, and study equivalence and containment. We also study the evaluation and enumeration problems for this class of queries.

Conventional security techniques like signature-based detection of malware and regular updates of a signature database are not feasible solutions as they cannot secure such systems effectively, having limited resources. Programming languages permitting immediate memory accesses through pointers often result in applications having memory-related errors, which may lead to unpredictable failures and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, energy efficient IoT devices running on batteries cannot afford the implementation of cryptography algorithms as such techniques have significant impact on the system power consumption. Therefore, in order to operate IoT in a secure manner, the system must be able to detect and prevent any kind of intrusions before the network (i.e., sensor nodes and base station) is destabilised by the attackers. In this article, we have presented an intrusion detection and prevention mechanism by implementing an intelligent security architecture using random neural networks (RNNs). The application’s source code is also instrumented at compile time in order to detect out-of-bound memory accesses. It is based on creating tags, to be coupled with each memory allocation and then placing additional tag checking instructions for each access made to the memory. To validate the feasibility of the proposed security solution, it is implemented for an existing IoT system and its functionality is practically demonstrated by successfully detecting the presence of any suspicious sensor node within the system operating range and anomalous activity in the base station with an accuracy of 97.23%. Overall, the proposed security solution has presented a minimal performance overhead."

We propose several dependency and constituent-based structures, also enriched with Linked Open Data (LD) knowledge to represent pairs of questions and answer passages. We encode such tree structures in learning-to-rank (L2R) algorithms using tree kernels, which can project them in tree substructure spaces, where each dimension represents a powerful syntactic/semantic feature. Additionally, since we define links between question and passage structures, our tree kernel spaces also include relational structural features. We carried out an extensive comparative experimentation of our models for automatic answer selection benchmarks on different TREC QA corpora as well as the newer Wikipedia-based dataset, namely WikiQA, which has been widely used to test sentence rerankers. The results consistently demonstrate that our structural semantic models achieve the state of the art in passage reranking. In particular, we derived the following important findings: (i) relational syntactic structures are essential to achieve superior results; (ii) models trained with dependency trees can outperform those trained with shallow trees, e.g., in case of sentence reranking; (iii) external knowledge automatically generated with focus and question classifiers is very effective; and (iv) the semantic information derived by LD and incorporated in syntactic structures can be used to replace the knowledge provided by the above-mentioned classifiers. This is a remarkable advantage as it enables our models to increase coverage and portability over new domains."

essential for human life and it is fundamental to the human experience. Food-related study may support multifarious applications and services, such as guiding human behavior, improving human health, and understanding the culinary culture. With the rapid development of social networks, mobile networks, and Internet of Things (IoT), people commonly upload, share, and record food images, recipes, cooking videos, and food diaries, leading to large-scale food data. Large-scale food data offers rich knowledge about food and can help tackle many central issues of human society. Therefore, it is time to group several disparate issues related to food computing. Food computing acquires and analyzes heterogenous food data from different sources for perception, recognition, retrieval, recommendation, and monitoring of food. In food computing, computational approaches are applied to address food-related issues in medicine, biology, gastronomy, and agronomy. Both large-scale food data and recent breakthroughs in computer science are transforming the way we analyze food data. Therefore, a series of works has been conducted in the food area, targeting different food-oriented tasks and applications. However, there are very few systematic reviews that shape this area well and provide a comprehensive and in-depth summary of current efforts or detail open problems in this area. In this article, we formalize food computing and present such a comprehensive overview of various emerging concepts, methods, and tasks. We summarize key challenges and future directions ahead for food computing. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets the study of computing technology for the food area and also offers a collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers and practitioners working in different food-related fields."

Developing effective methods to detect them early is of paramount importance. A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users’ text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings."

Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.

A Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) that automatically adapts to learner characteristics such as learning styles and knowledge level can recommend appropriate learning resources that would favor the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The pure cold-start problem is a relevant issue in PLEs, which arises due to the lack of prior information about the new learner in the PLE to create appropriate recommendations. This article introduces a semantic framework based on ontology to address the pure cold-start problem in content recommenders. The ontology encapsulates the domain knowledge about the learners as well as Learning Objects (LOs). The semantic model that we built has been experimented with different combinations of the key learner parameters such as learning style, knowledge level, and background knowledge. The proposed framework utilizes these parameters to build natural learner groups from the learner ontology using SPARQL queries. The ontology holds 480 learners’ data, 468 annotated learning objects with 5,600 learner ratings. A multivariate k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data, is used to evaluate the learner similarity computation accuracy. The learner satisfaction achieved with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given by the 40 participants of the experiments. From the evaluation perspective, it is evident that 79% of the learners are satisfied with the recommendations generated by the proposed model in pure cold-start condition."

To improve the representation learning of the Tibetan knowledge graph, we propose a joint model to merge structure and entity description information based on the Translating Embeddings and Convolution Neural Networks models.

However, maintaining a consistent messaging tone for a brand has become more challenging with the virtual explosion in the amount of content that needs to be authored and pushed to the Internet to maintain an edge in the era of digital marketing. To understand the depth of the problem, we collect around 300K web page content from around 650 companies. We develop trait-specific classification models by considering the linguistic features of the content. The classifier automatically identifies the web articles that are not consistent with the mission and vision of a company and further helps us to discover the conditions under which the consistency cannot be maintained. To address the brand inconsistency issue, we then develop a sentence ranking system that outputs the top three sentences that need to be changed for making a web article more consistent with the company’s brand personality.

While clearly improving the performance of the end-to-end training task, these existing semantic-driven methods still have clear limitations: for example, (i) they only utilize shallow semantic signals (e.g., from topic models) with only a single stochastic hidden layer in their data generation process, which suffer easily from noise (especially adapted for short-text etc.) and lack of interpretation; (ii) they ignore the sentence order and document context, as they treat each document as a bag of sentences, and fail to capture the long-distance dependencies and global semantic meaning of a document. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel semantic-driven language modeling framework, which is a method to learn a Hierarchical Language Model and a Recurrent Conceptualization-enhanced Gamma Belief Network, simultaneously. For scalable inference, we develop the auto-encoding Variational Recurrent Inference, allowing efficient end-to-end training and simultaneously capturing global semantics from a text corpus. Especially, this article introduces concept information derived from high-quality lexical knowledge graph Probase, which leverages strong interpretability and anti-nose capability for the proposed model. Moreover, the proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal transitions between sentences and inter-sentence concept dependence. Experiments conducted on several NLP tasks validate the superiority of the proposed approach, which could effectively infer meaningful hierarchical concept structure of document and hierarchical multi-scale structures of sequences, even compared with latest state-of-the-art Transformer-based models."

PredictRoute's strategy for exploring network paths discovers 4X more autonomous system (AS) hops than other well-known strategies used in practice today. Using a corpus of traceroutes, PredictRoute trains probabilistic models of routing towards prefixes on the Internet to predict network paths and their likelihood. PredictRoute's AS-path predictions differ from the measured path by at most 1 hop, 75% of the time.

The bacterium's major virulence factors are (a) the anthrax toxins and (b) an antiphagocytic polyglutamic capsule. These are encoded by two large plasmids, the former by pXO1 and the latter by pXO2. The expression of both is controlled by the bicarbonate-responsive transcriptional regulator, AtxA. The anthrax toxins are three polypeptides—protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF)—that come together in binary combinations to form lethal toxin and edema toxin. PA binds to cellular receptors to translocate LF (a protease) and EF (an adenylate cyclase) into cells. The toxins alter cell signaling pathways in the host to interfere with innate immune responses in early stages of infection and to induce vascular collapse at late stages.

The model was used to investigate the relative contributions of medullary blood flow autoregulation and inhibition of transport in the proximal convoluted tubule to pressure natriuresis in both diuresis and antidiuresis. The model predicts that medullary blood flow autoregulation, which only affects the interstitial solute composition in the model, has negligible influence on the rate of NaCl excretion. However, it exerts a significant effect on urine flow, particularly in the antidiuretic kidney. This suggests that interstitial washout has significant implications for the maintenance of hydration status but little direct bearing on salt excretion, and that medullary blood flow may only play a signaling role for stimulating a pressure-natriuresis response. Inhibited reabsorption in the model proximal convoluted tubule is capable of driving pressure natriuresis when the known actions of vasopressin on the collecting duct epithelium are taken into account."

At stimulus intensities near to or above resting motor threshold, low-frequency rTMS (∼1 Hz) decreases motor cortical excitability, whereas high-frequency rTMS (5–20 Hz) can increase excitability. We investigated the effect of 10 min of intermittent rTMS on motor cortical excitability in normal subjects at two frequencies (2 or 6 Hz). Three low intensities of stimulation (70, 80, and 90% of active motor threshold) and sham stimulation were used. The number of stimuli were matched between conditions. Motor cortical excitability was investigated by measurement of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) evoked by single magnetic stimuli in the relaxed first dorsal interosseus muscle. The intensity of the single stimuli was set to evoke baseline MEPs of ∼1 mV in amplitude. Both 2- and 6-Hz stimulation, at 80% of active motor threshold, reduced the magnitude of MEPs for ∼30 min ( P &lt; 0.05). MEPs returned to baseline values after a weak voluntary contraction. Stimulation at 70 and 90% of active motor threshold and sham stimulation did not induce a significant group effect on MEP magnitude. However, the intersubject response to rTMS at 90% of active motor threshold was highly variable, with some subjects showing significant MEP facilitation and others inhibition. These results suggest that, at low stimulus intensities, the intensity of stimulation may be as important as frequency in determining the effect of rTMS on motor cortical excitability. "

Using the paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm, we can measure interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) and interhemispheric facilitation (IHF) as indexes of the interhemispheric interactions in humans. We investigated how quadripulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (QPS), one form of repetitive TMS (rTMS), on M1 affects the contralateral M1 and the interhemispheric interactions. QPS is able to induce bidirectional plastic changes in M1 depending on the interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of TMS pulses: long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effect by QPS-5 protocol, and long-term depression-like effect by QPS-50, whose numbers indicate the ISI (ms). Twelve healthy subjects were enrolled. We applied QPS over the left M1 and recorded several parameters before and 30 min after QPS. QPS-5, which increased motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by left M1 activation, also increased MEPs induced by right M1 activation. Meanwhile, QPS-50, which decreased MEPs elicited by left M1 activation, did not induce any significant changes in MEPs elicited by right M1 activation. None of the resting motor threshold, active motor threshold, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, and short-interval intracortical inhibition in right M1 were affected by QPS. IHI and IHF from left to right M1 significantly increased after left M1 QPS-5. The degree of left first dorsal interosseous MEP amplitude change by QPS-5 significantly correlated with the degree of IHF change. We suppose that the LTP-like effect on the contralateral M1 may be produced by some interhemispheric interactions through the corpus callosum. "

As hypothesized, performance was disrupted when rTMS was delivered over the pre-SMA at the beginning of the second chunk but not when it was delivered in the middle of a chunk. Contrary to the hypothesis, TMS did not disrupt sequence initiation. Experiments 3 and 4 examined whether the very first movement of a sequence could be disrupted under any circumstances. Pre-SMA TMS did disrupt the initiation of sequences but only when subjects had to switch between sequences and when the first movement of each sequence was not covertly instructed by a learned visuomotor association. In conjunction, the results suggest that for overlearned sequences the pre-SMA is primarily concerned with the initiation of a sequence or sequence chunk and the role of the pre-SMA in sequence initiation is only discerned when subjects must retrieve the sequence from memory as a superordinate set of movements without the aid of a visuomotor association. Control experiments revealed such effects were not present when rTMS was applied over the left dorsal premotor cortex. "

The effects of rTMS depend critically on stimulus frequency. The aim of our present study was to compare the effects of different rTMS protocols. We compared the aftereffects of 6 different rTMS protocols [paired associative stimulation at interstimulus intervals of 25 (PAS<jats:sub>25</jats:sub>) and 10 ms (PAS<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>); theta burst stimulation delivered as continuous (cTBS) or intermittent delivery pattern (iTBS); 1- and 5-Hz rTMS] on the excitability of stimulated and contralateral motor cortex in 10 healthy subjects. A pronounced increase of cortical excitability, evaluated by measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), was produced by iTBS (+56%) and PAS<jats:sub>25</jats:sub> (+45%). Five-hertz rTMS did not produce a significant increase of MEPs. A pronounced decrease of cortical excitability was produced by PAS<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> (−31%), cTBS (−29%), and 1-Hz rTMS (−20%). Short-interval intracortical inhibition was suppressed by PAS<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>. Cortical silent period duration was increased by 1-Hz stimulation. No significant effect was observed in the contralateral hemisphere.

Here we combined two interventional protocols that induce long-term depression (LTD)–like or long-term potentiation (LTP)–like plasticity in left M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub> through different afferents. We hypothesized that the left M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub> would integrate LTP- and LTD-like plasticity in a homeostatic fashion. In ten healthy volunteers, low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMD) was first applied to produce an LTP-like increase (5 Hz rTMS) or LTD-like decrease (1 Hz rTMS) in corticospinal excitability in left M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub> via premotor-to-motor inputs. Following PMD rTMS, paired-associative stimulation (PAS) was applied to the right median nerve and left M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub> to induce spike-time–dependent plasticity in sensory-to-motor inputs to left M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub>. We adjusted the interstimulus interval to the N20 latency of the median nerve somatosensory-evoked cortical potential to produce an LTP-like increase (PAS<jats:sub>N20+2ms</jats:sub>) or an LTD-like decrease (PAS<jats:sub>N20−5ms</jats:sub>) in corticospinal excitability. The amplitude of motor-evoked potentials was recorded from intrinsic hand muscles to assess stimulation-induced changes in corticospinal excitability. Premotor-to-motor preconditioning triggered a homeostatic response to subsequent sensory-to-motor PAS. After facilitatory 5 Hz rTMS, “facilitatory” PAS<jats:sub>N20+2ms</jats:sub> suppressed corticospinal excitability. Likewise, “inhibitory” PAS<jats:sub>N20−5ms</jats:sub> facilitated corticospinal excitability after “inhibitory” 1 Hz rTMS. There was a negative linear relationship between the excitability changes induced by PMD rTMS and those elicited by subsequent PAS. Excitability changes were not paralleled by changes in performance during a finger-tapping task. These results provide evidence for a homeostatic response pattern in the human M1<jats:sub>HAND</jats:sub> that integrates acute plastic changes evoked through different “input channels.” "

Recently, some local solutions based on matching cost filtering with an edge-preserving filter have been proved to be capable of achieving more accuracy than global approaches. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of these algorithms is quadratically related to the window size used to aggregate the matching costs. The recent trend has been to pursue higher accuracy with greater efficiency in execution. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cost-aggregation module to compute the matching responses for all the image pixels at a set of sampling points generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The complexity of this implementation is linear both in the number of image pixels and the number of clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art local methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. Moreover, performance tests indicate that parameters such as the height of the hierarchical binary tree and the spatial and range standard deviations have a significant influence on time consumption and the accuracy of disparity maps."

In this paper, a new comprehensive mathematical model is established to analyze the production performance of multiple fractured horizontal well (MFHW) in box-shaped shale gas reservoir considering multiscaled flow mechanisms (ad/desorption and Fick diffusion). In the model, the adsorbed gas is assumed not directly diffused into the natural macrofractures but into the macropores of matrix first and then flows into the natural fractures. The ad/desorption phenomenon of shale gas on the matrix particles is described by a combination of the Langmuir’s isothermal adsorption equation, continuity equation, gas state equation, and the motion equation in matrix system. On the basis of the Green’s function theory, the point source solution is derived under the assumption that gas flow from macropores into natural fractures follows transient interporosity and absorbed gas diffused into macropores from nanopores follows unsteady-state diffusion.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders affecting predominantly the motor cortex and pyramidal tract, which results in slowly progressing gait disorders, as well as spasticity and weakness of lower extremities. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been previously investigated as a therapeutic tool for similar motor deficits in a number of neurologic conditions. The aim of this randomized, controlled trial was to investigate the therapeutic potential of rTMS in various forms of HSP, including pure and complicated forms, as well as adrenomyeloneuropathy. <jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. We recruited 15 patients (five women and 10 men; mean age <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:mn>43.7</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>10.6</mml:mn></mml:math> years) with the mentioned forms of HSP. The intervention included five sessions of bilateral 10 Hz rTMS over primary motor areas of the muscles of lower extremities and five sessions of similar sham stimulation. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. One patient dropped out due to seizure, and 14 patients completed the study protocol. After real stimulation, the strength of the proximal and distal muscles of lower extremities increased, and the spasticity of the proximal muscles decreased. Change in spasticity was still present during follow-up assessment. No effect was observed regarding gait velocity. No changes were seen after sham stimulation. A post hoc analysis revealed an inverse relation between motor threshold and the change of the strength after active rTMS. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>. rTMS may have potential in improving weakness and spasticity of lower extremities in HSP, especially of proximal muscles whose motor areas are located more superficially.

The cost of obtaining high quality triples is high and the data sources are facing a serious problem of data sparsity, which may result in insufficient training of long-tail entities. However, unstructured text encoding entities and relational knowledge can be obtained anywhere in large quantities. Word vectors of entity names estimated from the unlabelled raw text using natural language model encode syntax and semantic properties of entities. Yet since these feature vectors are estimated through minimizing prediction error on unsupervised entity names, they may not be the best for knowledge graphs. We propose a two-phase approach to adapt unsupervised entity name embeddings to a knowledge graph subspace and jointly learn the adaptive matrix and knowledge representation. Experiments on Freebase show that our method can rely less on the labelled data and outperforms the baselines when the labelled data is relatively less.

In this paper, we propose a method to construct the dispatch knowledge graph for the power grid. By leveraging on dispatch data from the power domain, this method first extracts entities and then identifies dispatching behavior relationship patterns.

However, the relay node forwarding in the wireless transmission process brings greater risks to data leakage, and the computing power and energy of the UAV consumption is limited, so a lighter solution is required. This paper proposes a mechanism for the safe allocation of UAV swarm mission resources based on random labels. Each task has a random label to solve the problem of database security and wireless transmission security in the process of UAV task assignment. Furthermore, a lightweight stream cipher encryption scheme is illustrated to ensure the security of the UAV database. The irreversible hash function SHA-256 and the lightweight foam structure hash function SPONGENT-128 are used to generate random labels and then allocate task resources. In the case of energy consumption, it reduces the possibility of the enemy successfully obtaining private data.

However, communications in UAVN confront many security issues, for example, malicious entities may launch impersonate attacks. In UAVN, the command center (CMC) needs to perform mutual authentication with unmanned aerial vehicles in clusters. The aggregator (AGT) can verify the authenticity of authentication request from CMC; then, the attested authentication request is broadcasted to the reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the same cluster. The authentication responses from UAVs can be verified and aggregated by AGT before being sent to CMC for validation. Also, existing solutions cannot resist malicious key generation center (KGC). To address these issues, this paper proposes a pairing-free authentication scheme (CLAS) for UAVNs based on the certificateless signature technology, which supports batch verification at both AGT and CMC sides so that the verification efficiency can be improved greatly. Security analysis shows that our CLAS scheme can guarantee the unforgeability for (attested) authentication request and (aggregate) responses in all phases.

After MRI acquisition, R2* signal was used to calculate FMX levels in plasma, reference tissue, and tumor lesions by comparison with a phantom-based standard curve. Patients then received nal-IRI (70 mg/m2 free base strength) biweekly until progression. Two percutaneous core biopsies were collected from selected tumor lesions 72 hours after FMX or nal-IRI.Results: Iron particle levels were quantified by FMX-MRI in plasma, reference tissues, and tumor lesions in 13 of 15 eligible patients. On the basis of a mechanistic pharmacokinetic model, tissue permeability to FMX correlated with early FMX-MRI signals at 1 and 24 hours, while FMX tissue binding contributed at 72 hours. Higher FMX levels (ranked relative to median value of multiple evaluable lesions from 9 patients) were significantly associated with reduction in lesion size by RECIST v1.1 at early time points (P &amp;lt; 0.001 at 1 hour and P &amp;lt; 0.003 at 24 hours FMX-MRI, one-way ANOVA). No association was observed with post-FMX levels at 72 hours. Irinotecan drug levels in lesions correlated with patient's time on treatment (Spearman ρ = 0.7824; P = 0.0016).Conclusions: Correlation between FMX levels in tumor lesions and nal-IRI activity suggests that lesion permeability to FMX and subsequent tumor uptake may be a useful noninvasive and predictive biomarker for nal-IRI response in patients with solid tumors.

            </jats:bold>
            Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activation in poststroke aphasia. It remains unclear whether this activation is essential for language performance. We tested this hypothesis in a positron emission tomography (PET) activation study during a semantic task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on right-handed patients experiencing poststroke aphasia and examined whether rTMS stimulation over the right and left IFG would interfere with language performance.

            Eleven patients with left-sided middle cerebral arterial infarction, 50 to 75 years of age, were tested with the Aachen Aphasia Test Battery and underwent

            O PET activation during a semantic task within 2 weeks after stroke. PET activation images were coregistered to T1-weighted MRIs. Stimulation sites were determined on renderings of head and brain over the maximum activation within left and right IFG. rTMS was performed with 20% maximum output (2.1 T), 10-s train duration, at 4Hz frequency. A positive rTMS effect was defined as an increased reaction time latency or error rate in the semantic task.

              <jats:italic>Results—</jats:italic>
            </jats:bold>
            PET activations of the IFG were observed on the left (3 patients) and bilaterally (8 patients). Right IFG stimulation was positive in 5 patients with right IFG activation, indicating essential language function. In a verbal fluency task, these patients had a lower performance than patients without right-sided TMS effect.
          
          
            <jats:bold>
              <jats:italic>Conclusions—</jats:italic>
            </jats:bold>
            In some poststroke aphasics, right IFG activation is essential for residual language function. However, its compensatory potential seems to be less effective than in patients who recover left IFG function. These results suggest a hierarchy in recovery from poststroke aphasia and a (limited) compensatory potential of the nondominant hemisphere.

Subjects were required to perform a task consisting of two parts: a study phase (encoding), in which word pairs were presented, and a test phase (retrieval), during which stimuli previously presented had to be recognized among other stimuli. Consistently with our previous findings using pictures, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had a significant impact on episodic memory. The performance was significantly disrupted when rTMS was applied to the left or right DLPFC during encoding, and to the right DLPFC in retrieval, but only for unrelated word pairs. These results indicate that the nature of the material to be remembered interacts with the encoding–retrieval DLPFC asymmetry; moreover, the crucial role of DLPFC is evident only for novel stimuli."

               Previous studies have implicated the human parietal lobes in the on-line guidance of action. However, no study to date has examined at what stage in the on-line adjustment process do the parietal lobes play their most critical role. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied over the left intraparietal sulcus as participants reached to grasp a small or large illuminated cylinder. On some trials, the illumination could suddenly switch from the small to large cylinder, or vice-versa. Small–Large switches were associated with relatively early grip aperture adjustments, whereas Large–Small switches were associated with relatively late grip aperture adjustments.
               When rTMS was applied early in the movement, it disrupted on-line adjustments to Small–Large target switches, but not to Large–Small switches. Conversely, when rTMS was applied late in the movement, it disrupted adjustments to Large–Small target switches but not to Small–Large switches. The timing of the disruption by rTMS appeared linked to the initiation of the adjustment. It was concluded that the left parietal lobe plays a critical role in initiating an on-line adjustment to a change in target size, but not in executing that adjustment. The implications of these results for current views of on-line control are discussed."

This has led to many communities asking “What is FAIR?” and “How FAIR are we currently?”, questions which were addressed respectively by a publication revisiting the principles and the emergence of FAIR metrics. However, early adopters of the FAIR principles have already run into the next question: “How can we become (more) FAIR?” This question is more difficult to answer, as the principles do not prescribe any specific standard or implementation. Moreover, there does not yet exist a mature ecosystem of tools, platforms and standards to support human and machine agents to manage, produce, publish and consume FAIR data in a user-friendly and efficient (i.e., “easy”) way. In this paper we will show, however, that there are already many emerging examples of FAIR tools under development. This paper puts forward the position that we are likely already in a creolization phase where FAIR tools and technologies are merging and combining, before converging in a subsequent phase to solutions that make FAIR feasible in daily practice.

Recently, these metrics have been implemented into a software that can automatically harvest metadata from metadata providers and generate a principle-specific FAIRness evaluation. With so many different approaches for FAIRness evaluations, we believe that further clarification on their limitations and advantages, as well as on their interpretation and interplay should be considered.

Various biomedical associations, e.g., drug-virus and viral protein-host protein interactions, can be used for building biomedical knowledge graphs. Based on these sources, large-scale knowledge reasoning algorithms can be used to predict new links between antiviral drugs and viruses. To utilize the various heterogeneous biomedical associations, we proposed a fusion strategy to integrate the results of two tensor decomposition-based models (i.e., CP-N3 and ComplEx-N3). Sufficient experiments indicated that our method obtained high performance (MRR=0.2328). Compared with CP-N3, the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is increased by 3.3% and compared with ComplEx-N3, the MRR is increased by 3.5%. Meanwhile, we explored the relationship between the performance and relationship types, which indicated that there is a negative correlation (PCC=0.446, P-value=2.26e-194) between the performance of triples predicted by our method and edge betweenness."

               Understanding the contributions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to working memory is central to understanding the neural bases of high-level cognition. One question that remains controversial is whether the same areas of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) that participate in the manipulation of information in working memory also contribute to its short-term retention (STR). We evaluated this question by first identifying, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brain areas involved in manipulation. Next, these areas were targeted with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) while subjects performed tasks requiring only the STR or the STR plus manipulation of information in working memory. fMRI indicated that manipulation-related activity was independent of retention-related activity in both the PFC and superior parietal lobule (SPL). rTMS, however, yielded a different pattern of results. Although rTMS of the dlPFC selectively disrupted manipulation, rTMS of the SPL disrupted manipulation and STR to the same extent. rTMS of the postcentral gyrus (a control region) had no effect on performance. The implications of these results are twofold. In the PFC, they are consistent with the view that this region contributes more importantly to the control of information in working memory than to its STR. In the SPL, they illustrate the importance of supplementing the fundamentally correlational data from neuroimaging with a disruptive method, which affords stronger inference about structure-function relations."

               Many studies have shown that visuospatial orienting attention depends on a network of frontal and parietal areas in the right hemisphere. Rushworth et al. [Rushworth, M. F., Krams, M., &amp; Passingham, R. E. The attentional role of the left parietal cortex: The distinct lateralization and localization of motor attention in the human brain. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 13, 698–710, 2001] have recently provided evidence for a left-lateralized network of parietal areas involved in motor attention. Using two variants of a cued reaction time (RT) task, we set out to investigate whether high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; 5 Hz) delivered “off-line” in a virtual lesion paradigm over the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) would affect performance in a motor versus a visual attention task. Although rTMS over the DLPFC on either side did not affect RT performance on a spatial orienting task, it did lead to an increase in the RTs of invalidly cued trials in a motor attention task when delivered to the left DLPFC. The opposite effect was found when rTMS was delivered to the PPC: In this case, conditioning the right PPC led to increased RTs in invalidly cued trials located in the left hemispace, in the spatial orienting task. rTMS over the PPC on either side did not affect performance in the motor attention task. This double dissociation was evident in the first 10 min after rTMS conditioning. These results enhance our understanding of the networks associated with attention. They provide evidence of a role for the left DLPFC in the mechanisms of motor preparation, and confirm Mesulam's original proposal for a right PPC dominance in spatial attention [Mesulam, M. M. A cortical network for directed attention and unilateral neglect. Annals of Neurology, 10, 309–325, 1981]."

               To investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the central processing of motor preparation, we had subjects perform a precued-choice reaction time (RT) task. They had to press one of two buttons as quickly as possible after a go signal specifying both the hand to be used and the button to press. A precue preceding this signal conveyed full, partial, or no advance information (hand and/or button), such that RT shortened with increasing amount of information. We applied 1200 to 2400 pulses of 1-Hz rTMS over various cortical areas and compared the subjects' performances at various times before and after this intervention. rTMS delayed RT at two distinct phases after stimulation, one within 10 min and another with a peak at 20 to 30 min and lasting for 60 to 90 min, with no significant effects on error rates or movement time. The effect was significantly larger on left- than on right-hand responses. RT was prominently delayed over the premotor and motor cortices with similar effects across different conditions of advance information, suggesting that preparatory processes relatively close to the formation of motor output were influenced by rTMS. In contrast, the effect of rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the anterior parietal cortex varied with the amount of advance information, indicating specific roles played by these areas in integrating target and effector information. The primary motor area, especially of the left hemisphere, may take over this processing, implementing motor output based on the information processed in other areas."

We addressed this important issue by performing two experiments in which repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was administered in different sessions to the left or right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) or vertex; in both tasks, two visual stimuli were presented serially and subjects were asked to judge if the second stimulus was longer than the first (standard) stimulus. rTMS was presented on 50% of trials. Consistent with a previous literature demonstrating the effect of auditory clicks on temporal judgment, rTMS was associated with a tendency to perceive the paired visual stimulus as longer in all conditions. Crucially, rTMS to the right SMG was associated with a significantly greater subjective prolongation of the associated visual stimulus in both experiments. These findings demonstrate that the right SMG is an important element of the neural system underlying temporal processing and, as discussed, have implications for neural and cognitive models of temporal perception and attention."

Because the caudal part of the Broca's region (left Brodmann's area 44, BA 44) is involved in processing hierarchically organized behaviors, we aimed to test the hypothesis that this area may also play a role in learning structured motor sequences. To address this issue, we investigated the inhibitory effects of a continuous theta-burst TMS (cTBS) applied over left BA 44 in healthy subjects, just before they performed a serial RT task (SRTT). SRTT has been widely used to study motor skill learning and is also of interest because, for complex structured sequences, subjects spontaneously organize them into smaller subsequences, referred to as chunks. As a control, cTBS was applied over the vertex in another group, which underwent the same experiment. Control subjects showed both a general practice learning effect, evidenced by a progressive decrease in RT across blocks and a sequence-specific learning effect, demonstrated by a significant RT increase in a pseudorandom sequence. In contrast, when cTBS was applied over left BA 44, subjects lacked both the general practice and sequence-specific learning effects. However, surprisingly, their chunking pattern was preserved and remained indistinguishable from controls. The present study indicates that left BA 44 plays a role in motor sequence learning, but without being involved in elementary chunking. This dissociation between chunking and sequence learning could be explained if we postulate that left BA 44 intervenes in high hierarchical level processing, possibly to integrate elementary chunks together."

Interestingly, levels of productivity and microlinguistic processing were unaffected by the stimulation. These results suggest that the dorsal aspect of the anterior left inferior frontal gyrus is an epicenter of a wider neural network subserving the selection of contextually appropriate semantic representations."

Previous neuroimaging evidence has supported a dissociation in language comprehension in which parts of the MTG are involved in the retrieval of lexical syntactic information and the IFG in unification operations that maintain, select, and integrate multiple sources of information over time. In the present investigation, we tested for causal evidence of this dissociation by modulating activity in IFG and MTG using an offline TMS procedure: continuous theta-burst stimulation. Lexical–syntactic retrieval was manipulated by using sentences with and without a temporarily word-class (noun/verb) ambiguity (e.g., run). In one group of participants, TMS was applied to the IFG and MTG, and in a control group, no TMS was applied. Eye movements were recorded and quantified at two critical sentence regions: a temporarily ambiguous region and a disambiguating region. Results show that stimulation of the IFG led to a modulation of the ambiguity effect (ambiguous–unambiguous) at the disambiguating sentence region in three measures: first fixation durations, total reading times, and regressive eye movements into the region. Both IFG and MTG stimulation modulated the ambiguity effect for total reading times in the temporarily ambiguous sentence region relative to the control group. The current results demonstrate that an offline repetitive TMS protocol can have influences at a different point in time during online processing and provide causal evidence for IFG involvement in unification operations during sentence comprehension."

Compared with sham stimulation, magnetic stimulation (1 Hz for 1 min) over both left and right AG, but not over FEF or intraparietal sulcus, core regions of the dorsal attention network, enhanced the dominant alpha power density (8–10 Hz) in occipitoparietal cortex. Furthermore, right AG-rTMS enhanced intrahemispheric alpha coherence (8–10 Hz). These results suggest that AG plays a causal role in the modulation of dominant low-frequency alpha rhythms in the resting-state condition."

Converting a journal had no spillover in terms of increased visits to previously published articles still behind the paywall in the same journals. Visits from previously subscribing Norwegian higher education institutions did not account for the increase in visits, indicating that the increase must be accounted for by visitors from other sectors.

However, most studies looking at whether OA has met this goal have focused on whether other scholars are making use of OA research. Few have considered how the broader public, including the news media, uses OA research.

               An increasing number of researchers rely on computational methods to generate or manipulate the results described in their scientific publications. Software created to this end—scientific software—is key to understanding, reproducing, and reusing existing work in many disciplines, ranging from Geosciences to Astronomy or Artificial Intelligence. However, scientific software is usually challenging to find, set up, and compare to similar software due to its disconnected documentation (dispersed in manuals, readme files, websites, and code comments) and the lack of structured metadata to describe it. As a result, researchers have to manually inspect existing tools to understand their differences and incorporate them into their work. This approach scales poorly with the number of publications and tools made available every year. In this paper we address these issues by introducing a framework for automatically extracting scientific software metadata from its documentation (in particular, their readme files); a methodology for structuring the extracted metadata in a Knowledge Graph (KG) of scientific software; and an exploitation framework for browsing and comparing the contents of the generated KG. We demonstrate our approach by creating a KG with metadata from over 10,000 scientific software entries from public code repositories."

               Current implementations of Open Access (OA) publishing frequently involve article processing charges (APCs). Increasing evidence has emerged that APCs impede researchers with fewer resources in publishing their research as OA. We analyzed 1.5 million scientific articles from journals listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals to assess average APCs and their determinants for a comprehensive set of journal publications across scientific disciplines, world regions, and through time. Levels of APCs were strongly stratified by scientific fields and the institutions’ countries, corroborating previous findings on publishing cultures and the impact of mandates of research funders. After controlling for country and scientific field with a multilevel mixture model, however, we found small to moderate effects of levels of institutional resourcing on the level of APCs. The effects were largest in countries with low GDP, suggesting decreasing marginal effects of institutional resources when general levels of funding are high. Our findings provide further evidence on how APCs stratify OA publishing and highlight the need for alternative publishing models."

Unfortunately, our understanding of how scholars use and frame citations has been limited to small-scale manual citation analysis of individual papers. We perform the largest behavioral study of citations to date, analyzing how scientific works frame their contributions through different types of citations and how this framing affects the field as a whole. We introduce a new dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for their function, and use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the papers of an entire field: Natural Language Processing. We then show how differences in framing affect scientific uptake and reveal the evolution of the publication venues and the field as a whole. We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and publication venue when citing, and that how a paper frames its work through citations is predictive of the citation count it will receive. Finally, we use changes in citation framing to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant increase in consensus. "

These prompts are usually manually created, and quite possibly sub-optimal; another prompt such as “ Obama worked as a __ ” may result in more accurately predicting the correct profession. Because of this, given an inappropriate prompt, we might fail to retrieve facts that the LM does know, and thus any given prompt only provides a lower bound estimate of the knowledge contained in an LM. In this paper, we attempt to more accurately estimate the knowledge contained in LMs by automatically discovering better prompts to use in this querying process. Specifically, we propose mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to automatically generate high-quality and diverse prompts, as well as ensemble methods to combine answers from different prompts. Extensive experiments on the LAMA benchmark for extracting relational knowledge from LMs demonstrate that our methods can improve accuracy from 31.1% to 39.6%, providing a tighter lower bound on what LMs know.

Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models.

               Pre-trained language representation models (PLMs) cannot well capture factual knowledge from text. In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagERepresentation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs. In KEPLER, we encode textual entity descriptions with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore, for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER, we construct Wikidata5M1 , a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER."

               Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental NLP task, commonly formulated as classification over a sequence of tokens. Morphologically rich languages (MRLs) pose a challenge to this basic formulation, as the boundaries of named entities do not necessarily coincide with token boundaries, rather, they respect morphological boundaries. To address NER in MRLs we then need to answer two fundamental questions, namely, what are the basic units to be labeled, and how can these units be detected and classified in realistic settings (i.e., where no gold morphology is available). We empirically investigate these questions on a novel NER benchmark, with parallel token- level and morpheme-level NER annotations, which we develop for Modern Hebrew, a morphologically rich-and-ambiguous language. Our results show that explicitly modeling morphological boundaries leads to improved NER performance, and that a novel hybrid architecture, in which NER precedes and prunes morphological decomposition, greatly outperforms the standard pipeline, where morphological decomposition strictly precedes NER, setting a new performance bar for both Hebrew NER and Hebrew morphological decomposition tasks."

               Many facts come with an expiration date, from the name of the President to the basketball team Lebron James plays for. However, most language models (LMs) are trained on snapshots of data collected at a specific moment in time. This can limit their utility, especially in the closed-book setting where the pretraining corpus must contain the facts the model should memorize. We introduce a diagnostic dataset aimed at probing LMs for factual knowledge that changes over time and highlight problems with LMs at either end of the spectrum—those trained on specific slices of temporal data, as well as those trained on a wide range of temporal data. To mitigate these problems, we propose a simple technique for jointly modeling text with its timestamp. This improves memorization of seen facts from the training time period, as well as calibration on predictions about unseen facts from future time periods. We also show that models trained with temporal context can be efficiently “refreshed” as new data arrives, without the need for retraining from scratch."

Studies testing these hypotheses have shown mixed support. We tested these hypotheses using the establishment success of non-native reptiles and congener presence/absence and richness across the globe. Our results demonstrated support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis. We found that globally, both on islands and continents, establishment success was higher in the presence than in the absence of congeners and that establishment success increased with increasing congener richness. At the life form level, establishment success was higher for lizards, marginally higher for snakes, and not different for turtles in the presence of congeners; data were insufficient to test the hypotheses for crocodiles. There was no relationship between establishment success and congener richness for any life form. We suggest that we found support for the pre-adaptation hypothesis because, at the scale of our analysis, native congeners represent environmental conditions appropriate for the species rather than competition for niche space. Our results imply that areas to target for early detection of non-native reptiles are those that host closely related species."

In total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded taxonomic concept of Trichodagmia were analyzed. Three species in the subgenus Aspathia and 10 species in the subgenus Simulium s.str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with Trichodagmia. In the Neighbour Joining analysis tree (NJ) derived from the DNA barcodes most of the specimens grouped together according to species or species groups as recognized by other morphotaxonomic studies. The interspecific genetic divergence averaged 11.2% (range 2.8–19.5%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0.5% (range 0–1.2%). Higher values of genetic divergence (3.2–3.7%) in species complexes suggest the presence of cryptic diversity. The existence of well defined groups within S. piperi, S. duodenicornium, S. canadense and S. rostratum indicate the possible presence of cryptic species within these taxa. Also, the suspected presence of a sibling species in S. tarsatum and S. paynei is supported. DNA barcodes also showed that specimens from species that were taxonomically difficult to delimit such as S. hippovorum, S. rubrithorax, S. paynei, and other related taxa (S. solarii), grouped together in the NJ analysis, confirming the validity of their species status. The recovery of partial barcodes from specimens in collections was time consuming and PCR success was low from specimens more than 10 years old. However, when a sequence was obtained, it provided good resolution for species identification. Larvae preserved in ‘weak’ Carnoy’s solution (9:1 ethanol:acetic acid) provided full DNA barcodes. Adding legs directly to the PCR mix from recently collected and preserved adults was an inexpensive, fast methodology to obtain full barcodes. In summary, DNA barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provides an effective approach for the delineation of species and for the discovery of hidden diversity in the subgenus Trichodagmia."

               This paper describes a dynamic framework for an atmospheric general circulation spectral model in which a reference stratified atmospheric temperature and a reference surface pressure are introduced into the governing equations so as to improve the calculation of the pressure gradient force and gradients of surface pressure and temperature. The vertical profile of the reference atmospheric temperature approximately corresponds to that of the U.S. midlatitude standard atmosphere within the troposphere and stratosphere, and the reference surface pressure is a function of surface terrain geopotential and is close to the observed mean surface pressure. Prognostic variables for the temperature and surface pressure are replaced by their perturbations from the prescribed references. The numerical algorithms of the explicit time difference scheme for vorticity and the semi-implicit time difference scheme for divergence, perturbation temperature, and perturbation surface pressure equation are given in detail. The modified numerical framework is implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model version 3 (CAM3) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to test its validation and impact on simulated climate. Both the original and the modified models are run with the same spectral resolution (T42), the same physical parameterizations, and the same boundary conditions corresponding to the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration from 1971 to 2000. This permits one to evaluate the performance of the new dynamic framework compared to the commonly used one.

These models demonstrate similar climate fidelity as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s previous Climate Model version 2.1 (CM2.1) while incorporating explicit and consistent carbon dynamics. The two models differ exclusively in the physical ocean component; ESM2M uses Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 with vertical pressure layers while ESM2G uses Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics with a bulk mixed layer and interior isopycnal layers. Differences in the ocean mean state include the thermocline depth being relatively deep in ESM2M and relatively shallow in ESM2G compared to observations. The crucial role of ocean dynamics on climate variability is highlighted in El Niño–Southern Oscillation being overly strong in ESM2M and overly weak in ESM2G relative to observations. Thus, while ESM2G might better represent climate changes relating to total heat content variability given its lack of long-term drift, gyre circulation, and ventilation in the North Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and depth structure in the overturning and abyssal flows, ESM2M might better represent climate changes relating to surface circulation given its superior surface temperature, salinity, and height patterns, tropical Pacific circulation and variability, and Southern Ocean dynamics. The overall assessment is that neither model is fundamentally superior to the other, and that both models achieve sufficient fidelity to allow meaningful climate and earth system modeling applications.

               The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved.
               Two versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2° latitude × 2.5° longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1° in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30° becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3° at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments.
               The control simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic.
               Both models have been used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/)."

Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations.

Here, the relationships between large and convective scales in observations and a stochastic multicloud model (SMCM) to ultimately support the design of a novel convection parameterization with stochastic elements are investigated. Observations of tropical convection obtained at Darwin and Kwajalein are used here. It is found that the variability of observed tropical convection generally decreases with increasing large-scale forcing, implying a transition from stochastic to more deterministic behavior with increasing forcing. Convection shows a more systematic relationship with measures related to large-scale convergence compared to measures related to energetics (e.g., CAPE). Using the observations, the parameters in the SMCM are adjusted. Then, the SMCM is forced with the time series of the observed large-scale state and the simulated convective behavior is compared to that observed. It is found that the SMCM cloud fields compare better with observations when using predictors related to convergence rather than energetics. Furthermore, the underlying framework of the SMCM is able to reproduce the observed functional dependencies of convective variability on the imposed large-scale state—an encouraging result on the road toward a novel convection parameterization approach. However, establishing sound cause-and-effect relationships between tropical convection and the large-scale environment remains problematic and warrants further research."

Estimates of precipitation and vegetation greenness are the two dominant satellite datasets. However, ignoring additional moisture- and energy-related processes that influence the response of vegetation to rainfall leads to an incomplete representation of the hydrologic cycle. This study evaluates the added value of considering multiple independent satellite-based variables to design, calibrate, and validate weather insurance indices on the African continent. The satellite data include two rainfall datasets, soil moisture, the evaporative stress index (ESI), and vegetation greenness. We limit artificial advantages by resampling all datasets to the same spatial (0.25°) and temporal (monthly) resolution, although datasets with a higher spatial resolution might have an added value, if considered as the single source of information for localized applications. A higher correlation coefficient between the moisture-focused variables and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator for vegetation vigor, provides evidence for the datasets’ capability to capture agricultural drought conditions on the ground. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset, soil moisture, and ESI show higher correlations with the (lagged) NDVI in large parts of Africa, for different land covers and various climate zones, than the African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2), rainfall dataset, which is often used in WII. A comparison to drought years as reported by farmers in Ethiopia, Senegal, and Zambia indicates a high “hit rate” of all satellite-derived anomalies regarding the detection of severe droughts but limitations regarding moderate drought events."

All patients aged 16 years or older who underwent a surgery with single intestinal anastomosis at Morristown Medical Center from January 2006 to June 2008 were entered into a prospective database. To compare the rate of AL, patients were divided into the following surgery-related groups: 1) stapled versus hand-sewn, 2) small bowel versus large bowel, 3) right versus left colon, 4) emergent versus elective, 5) laparoscopic versus converted (laparoscopic to open) versus open, 6) inflammatory bowel disease versus non inflammatory bowel disease, and 7) diverticulitis versus nondiverticulitis. We also looked for surgical site infection, estimated intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, comorbidities, preoperative chemotherapy, radiation, and anticoagulation treatment. The overall rate of AL was 3.8 per cent. Mortality rate was higher among patients with ALs (13.3%) versus patients with no AL (1.7%). Open surgery had greater risk of AL than laparoscopic operations. Surgical site infection and intraoperative blood transfusions were also associated with significantly higher rates of AL. Operations involving the left colon had greater risk of AL when compared with those of the right colon, sigmoid, and rectum. Prior chemotherapy, anticoagulation, and intraoperative blood loss all increased the AL rates. In conclusion, we identified several significant risk factors for ALs. This knowledge should help us better understand and prevent this serious complication, which has significant morbidity and mortality rates. "

To measure the disclosure of governmental financial information on the Internet, an index has been defined, taking into consideration the data considered to be relevant for a potential user, gathering the data visiting their websites. The results show that the way different countries use the Web for financial disclosure is deeply rooted in and follows from their administrative culture.

The increasing application of the NPM approach has placed public administration and management systems in the spotlight and raised a number of challenges. Among them are the relevance of policy importation and the availability of civil servants with the requisite competence to perform the very critical responsibilities of government that reforms introduce. Using the case of Mozambique, this article shows that implementation of public sector reforms has brought in its trail considerable gaps between reform strategies and the competences needed to execute them. Convinced that competences of public administrators are a vital prerequisite for the success of reforms, the government of Mozambique has instituted a series of training programmes to provide the kind of competences that would reflect the new demands and realities facing the public sector. Though it is too early to expect results, the article concludes that the technical, managerial and leadership skills of public administrators and managers are being improved through better training curricula than were provided in the past.Points for practitionersThe structure, functions, and processes of public administration and management have undergone remarkable changes as a result of NPM approaches. But as new approaches are being introduced, government managers have found themselves trying very hard to manage using old skills. In almost every profession, new circumstances require the development of new, or a redefinition of existing, skills. Institutionalizing new training curricula to provide technical, managerial and leadership competence for government administrators has become imperative now more than ever before. The caveat is that building new competencies will not necessarily fix all the problems unless other structural problems such as remuneration, promotion and utilization of ex-trainees are also addressed."

This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of socio-technical change.

Assuming that the thicknesses of the adherends are constant and are small in relation to the lateral dimensions of the bonded region, the adherends are treated as plates. Also, assuming that the thickness of the adhesive is small compared to that of the adherends, the thickness variation of the stresses in the adhesive layer is neglected. However, the transverse shear effects in the adherends and the in-plane normal strain in the adhesive are taken into ac count. The problem is reduced to a system of differential equations for the adhesive stresses which is solved in closed form. A single lap joint and a stif fened plate under various loading conditions are considered as examples. To verify the basic trend of the solutions obtained from the plate theory and to give some idea about the validity of the plate assumption itself, a sample pro blem is solved by using the finite element method and by treating the adherends and the adhesive as elastic continua. It is found that the plate theory used in the analysis not only predicts the correct trend for the adhesive stresses but also gives rather surprisingly accurate results. The solution is ob tained by assuming linear stress-strain relations for the adhesive. In the Ap pendix the problem is formulated by using a nonlinear material for the adhesive and by following two different approaches."

This case study is used to explore opportunities and tensions in the practical realisation of the smart city imaginary. Tensions are shown to be partly about the conjectural nature of the smart city debate.

It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city.

The contribution of this paper consists in providing a classification of the approaches used for the conversion of XML documents into OWL ontologies. This classification underlines the usage profile of each conversion method, providing a clear description of the advantages and drawbacks belonging to each method. Hence, this paper focuses on two main processes, which are ontology enrichment and ontology population using XML data. Ontology enrichment is related to the schema of the ontology (TBox), and ontology population is related to an individual (Abox). In addition, the ontologies described in these methods are based on formal languages of the Semantic Web such as OWL (Ontology Web Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework). These languages are formal because the semantics are formally defined and take advantage of the Description Logics. In contrast, XML data sources are without formal semantics. The XML language is used to store, export and share data between processes able to process the specific data structure. However, even if the semantics is not explicitly expressed, data structure contains the universe of discourse by using a qualified vocabulary regarding a consensual agreement. In order to formalize this semantics, the OWL language provides rich logical constraints. Therefore, these logical constraints are evolved in the transformation of XML documents into OWL documents, allowing the enrichment and the population of the target ontology. To design such a transformation, the current research field establishes connections between OWL constructs (classes, predicates, simple or complex data types, etc.) and XML constructs (elements, attributes, element lists, etc.). Two different approaches for the transformation process are exposed. The instance approaches are based on XML documents without any schema associated. The validation approaches are based on the XML schema and document validated by the associated schema. The second approaches benefit from the schema definition to provide automated transformations with logic constraints. Both approaches are discussed in the text. "

Most of the approaches in this field are focused on English due to the lack of sentiment resources in other languages such as the Arabic language and its large variety of dialects. In most sentiment analysis applications, good sentiment resources play a critical role. Based on that, in this article, several publicly available sentiment analysis resources for Arabic are introduced. This article introduces the Arabic senti-lexicon, a list of 3880 positive and negative synsets annotated with their part of speech, polarity scores, dialects synsets and inflected forms. This article also presents a Multi-domain Arabic Sentiment Corpus (MASC) with a size of 8860 positive and negative reviews from different domains. In this article, an in-depth study has been conducted on five types of feature sets for exploiting effective features and investigating their effect on performance of Arabic sentiment analysis. The aim is to assess the quality of the developed language resources and to integrate different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesise a more accurate sentiment analysis method. The Arabic senti-lexicon is used for generating feature vectors. Five well-known machine learning algorithms: naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines (SVMs), logistic linear regression and neural network are employed as base-classifiers for each of the feature sets. A wide range of comparative experiments on standard Arabic data sets were conducted, discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn. The experimental results show that the Arabic senti-lexicon is a very useful resource for Arabic sentiment analysis. Moreover, results show that classifiers which are trained on feature vectors derived from the corpus using the Arabic sentiment lexicon are more accurate than classifiers trained using the raw corpus."

Building on the concept of “partial organization”, the paper develops the concept of “meeting arena” as a hybrid of three forms of social order: organization, institution, and network. It is argued that the complex figuration of meeting arenas in a social movement or protest mobilization constitutes an infrastructure that synchronizes the dispersed activities of movement actors in time and space. This infrastructure is not an entirely emergent phenomenon but is also the result of conscious decisions by organizers.

Government's use of the Internet and other associated technologies, known as e-government, could become the instrument that makes regular timely information on public finances more forthcoming. New technologies can improve government responsiveness and empower individual citizens. By making government financial information available, the public could continuously assess a government agency through everyday interaction. The financial accountability of government and its response to public demands for information and services are thus a contribution to government openness. It is therefore relevant to determine whether public organizations are also becoming more aware of the importance of placing financial information on their Web sites to help in decision-making processes. This article focuses on the e-democracy process, specifically the transparency of government information, by analyzing governmental financial disclosures on the Web as a tool for the public to assess its financial accountability. To this end, an empirical study was carried out on regional governments in Spain. "

In this work we present a system for generating three-dimensional (3D) environment maps from data taken by stereo vision. At the core is a method for precise segmentation of range data into planar segments based on the algorithm of scan-line grouping extended to cope with the noise dynamics of stereo vision. In off-line experiments we demonstrate that our extensions achieve a more precise segmentation. When compared to a previously developed patch-let method, we obtain a richer segmentation with a higher accuracy while also requiring far less computations. From the obtained segmentation we then build a 3D environment map using occupancy grid and floor height maps. The resulting representation classifies areas into one of six different types while also providing object height information. We apply our perception method for the navigation of the humanoid robot QRIO and present experiments of the robot stepping through narrow space, walking up and down stairs and crawling underneath a table.

The problem is challenging because the optimal trajectory is located on the boundary of the set of dynamically feasible trajectories. This boundary is hard to model as it involves limitations of the entire system, including complex aerodynamic and electromechanical phenomena, in agile high-speed flight. In this work, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework that models the feasibility constraints based on analytical approximation, numerical simulation, and real-world flight experiments. By combining evaluations at different fidelities, trajectory time is optimized while the number of costly flight experiments is kept to a minimum. The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated for the trajectory generation problem in two different scenarios: (1) connecting predetermined waypoints; (2) planning in obstacle-rich environments. For each scenario, we conduct both simulation and real-world flight experiments at speeds up to 11 m/s. Resulting trajectories were found to be significantly faster than those obtained through minimum-snap trajectory planning. "

I argue that in addition to understanding the intensifying relationship between data, cities, and governance in terms of regimes of automated management and coordination in ‘actually existing’ smart cities, we should further engage with urban algorithmic governance and governmentality as material-discursive projects of future-ing, i.e., of anticipating particular kinds of cities-to-come. As urban big data looks to the future, it does so through the lens of an anticipatory security calculus fixated on identifying and diverting risks of urban anarchy and personal harm against which life in cities must be securitized. I suggest that such modes of algorithmic speculation are discernible at two scales of urban big data praxis: the scale of the body, and that of the city itself. At the level of the urbanite body, I use the selective example of mobile neighborhood safety apps to demonstrate how algorithmic governmentality enacts digital mediations of individual mobilities by routing individuals around ‘unsafe’ parts of the city in the interests of technologically ameliorating the risks of urban encounter. At the scale of the city, amongst other empirical examples, sentiment analytics approaches prefigure ephemeral spatialities of civic strife by aggregating and mapping individual emotions distilled from unstructured real-time content flows (such as Tweets). In both of these instances, the urban futures anticipated by the urban ‘big data security assemblage’ are highly uneven, as data and algorithms cannot divest themselves of urban inequalities and the persistence of their geographies.

Traffic speed is a significant parameter for reflecting congestion of road networks, which is feasible to predict. Traditional traffic forecasting methods have poor accuracy for complex urban road networks, and do not take into account weather and other multisource data. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based bidirectional spatial–temporal network (CNN-BDSTN) using traffic speed and weather data by crawling electric map information. In CNN-BDSTN, the spatial dependence of traffic network is captured by CNN to compose the time-series input dataset. Bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced to train the convolutional time-series dataset. Compared with linear regression, autoregressive integrated moving average, extreme gradient boosting, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, CNN-BDSTN presents its ability of spatial and temporal extension and achieves more accurately predicted results. In this case study, traffic speed data of 155 roads and weather information in Urumqi, Xinjiang, People’s Republic of China, with 1-min interval for 5 months are tested by CNN-BDSTN. The experiment results show that the accuracy of CNN-BDSTN with input of weather information is better than the scenario of no weather information, and the average predicted error is less than 5%. "

Trips with their origins, destinations, and travel times are now collected in publicly available databases, allowing for detailed demand forecasting with methods exploiting big and accurate data. In this paper, we predict the demand pattern of New York City bikes with a low-dimensional approach utilizing three-level data clustering. We use historical demand data along with temperature and precipitation to first aggregate and then decompose data to obtain meaningful clusters. The core of this approach lies in the proposed clustering technique, which reduces the dimension of the problem and, differently from other machine learning techniques, requires limited assumptions on the model or its parameters. The proposed method allows, for the given temperature and precipitation method, to obtain expected vector of movement (mean number and direction of trips) for each zone. In this paper, we synthesize more than 17 million trips into daily and zonal vectors of movement, which combined with weather data allow forecasting of the trip demand. The method allows us to predict the demand with over 75% accuracy, as shown in series of experiments in which various settings and parameterizations are validated against 25% holdout data. "

However, to build a long-term smart strategy capable of producing better returns from investments and deciding priorities regarding each city, a comprehensive SC governance framework is needed. The aim of this paper is to collect empirical evidences regarding government structures implemented in SCs and to outline a framework for the roles of local governments, nongovernmental agencies, and administrative officials. The survey shows that no consolidated standards or best practices for governing SCs are implemented in the examined cities; however, each city applies its own governance framework. Moreover, the study reveals some interesting experiences that may be useful for involving citizens and civil society in SC governance."

Several evaluation approaches and models have been put forward in literature and practice to measure smart cities. However, they are often normative or limited to certain aspects of cities’ “smartness”, and a more comprehensive and holistic approach seems to be lacking. Thus, building on a review of the literature and practice in the field, this paper aims to discuss the importance of adopting a holistic approach to the assessment of smart city governance and policy decision making. It also proposes a performance assessment framework that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and contributes to filling the current gap in the knowledge base in this domain. One of the innovative elements of the proposed framework is its holistic approach to policy evaluation. It is designed to address a smart city’s specificities and can benefit from the active participation of citizens in assessing the public value of policy decisions and their sustainability over time. We focus our attention on the performance measurement of codesign and coproduction by stakeholders and social innovation processes related to public value generation. More specifically, we are interested in the assessment of both the citizen centricity of smart city decision making and the processes by which public decisions are implemented, monitored, and evaluated as regards their capability to develop truly “blended” value services—that is, simultaneously socially inclusive, environmentally friendly, and economically sustainable.

A brief review of recent literature and the analysis of the included papers provide support for the assumption that cities cannot simply copy good practices but must develop approaches that fit their own situation ( contingency) and concord with their own organization in terms of broader strategies, human resource policies, information policies, and so on ( configuration). A variety of insights into the mechanisms and building blocks of smart city practices are presented, and issues for further research are identified. "

As an extension of the previous studies that consider them separately, this study integrates the two problems, especially in the form of multi-period model. Particularly, this study considers a generalized integrated problem in which disassembly levels may be different for the products of the same type. To describe the problem mathematically, we develop an integer programming model that minimizes the sum of setup, operation and inventory holding costs. Then, due to the problem complexity, a heuristic algorithm is proposed that consists of two phases: (a) constructing an initial solution using a priority-based greedy heuristic and (b) improving it by removing unnecessary disassembly operations after characterizing the properties of the problem. To show the performance of the heuristic algorithm, computational experiments were performed on various test instances and the results are reported. "

As an alternative, a cost-effective multifidelity metamodelling-based optimization strategy, where a metamodel of a high-fidelity aeroelastic simulation response is built by tuning a lower fidelity aeroelastic simulation response, is proposed. In order to address and validate such an approach, both linear and non-linear aeroelastic equations for an aerofoil employing different levels of complexity for expressing the aerodynamic load are used for the high- and low-fidelity models. An aeroelastic gust response evaluation problem is formulated for the flexible wing of a small unmanned air vehicle, whose characteristic size makes it particularly susceptible to gusts. Three different approaches to tune the low-fidelity model, both explicit and implicit, are investigated and compared. Good agreement between the high-fidelity model and the corrected low-fidelity one shows that the proposed approach is indeed suitable for optimization of the aeroelastic gust performance of flexible wings.

This work builds upon previous published work that created a multifidelity and multidisciplinary analysis and design optimization framework. Based on the usual aircraft conceptual design assumption that low-fidelity analyses are capable of converging upon a design through MDO that would at least be representative of that which would be predicted by higher fidelity methods, a process is created to allow low-fidelity multidisciplinary analysis runs to guide the higher fidelity optimization in an effort to reduce the total required computational expense. Due to disparate physical simulation results between the different fidelity levels, the expected reduction in computational effort was not realized. A separate low-fidelity optimization and a higher fidelity optimization were then subsequently performed. A MDO method that required an order of magnitude fewer objective function evaluations than the low-fidelity MDO method was developed to perform the more computationally expensive higher fidelity MDO in the full ESAV design space. Although optimal low-fidelity and higher fidelity ESAV configurations are identified, the low-fidelity optimal solution is infeasible when analyzed with the higher fidelity framework, and vice versa. This was a surprising and unexpected result as these two fidelity level model suites were developed by the same team for the same aircraft. The common assumption that low-fidelity MDO design methods will find a feasible design close to the eventual higher fidelity design did not hold for the ESAV case. Sensitivity studies were performed around the optimal design to gain insight into this important region of the design space with respect to the particular fidelity level models used. "

It will start by outlining an operational definition of music as a mode of social interaction in terms of its generic, cross-cultural properties that facilitates comparison with language as a universal human faculty. It will argue that, despite the fact that music appears much more heterogeneous and differentiated in function from culture to culture than does language, music possesses common attributes across cultures: it exploits the human capacity to entrain to external (particularly social) stimuli, and presents a rich set of semantic fields while under-determining meaning.  While language is held to possess both combinatoriality and semanticity, music is often claimed to be combinatorial but to lack semanticity. This paper will argue that music has semanticity, but that this semanticity is adapted for a different function from that of language. Music exploits the human capacity for entrainment, increasing the likelihood that participants will experience a sense of ‘shared intentionality’. It presents the characteristics of an ‘honest signal’ while under-specifying goals in ways that permit individuals to interact even while holding to personal interpretations of goals and meanings that may actually be in conflict. Music allows participants to explore the prospective consequences of their actions and attitudes towards others within a temporal framework that promotes the alignment of participants’ sense of goals. As a generic human faculty music thus provides a medium that is adapted to situations of social uncertainty, a medium by means of which a capacity for flexible social interaction can be explored and reinforced. It will be argued that a faculty for music is likely to have been exaptive in the evolution of the human capacity for complex social interaction. "

The first part presents the representational viewpoint on semantics and why one should aim at transcending this. The second part deals with different types of semantics, ranging from more mental to more corporeal ones. The third part discusses issues of semantics related to embodiment. It is argued that the embodiment approach, by focusing on the role of the human body as mediator in a musical meaning formation process, may be a useful extension, and may perhaps be an alternative to the representational approach. An embodied approach to music semantics is fully embedded within an empirical and evidence-based research approach. Within this approach, methodologies from both the natural sciences and the human sciences are combined. It focuses on the human body as a mediator between mind and physical environment, thus allowing a fully multimodal approach to music semantics. "

Postmortem examination revealed icterus, large amounts of serosanguineous fluid in the abdominal cavity, widespread petechiae and ecchymoses in several organs, and a large, pale, and well-demarcated focus of necrosis in the liver. Histologically, there was coagulative necrosis surrounded by a rim of inflammatory cells and large numbers of gram-positive rods, which were identified as Clostridium novyi by immunohistochemistry. Liver samples tested by PCR were positive for C. novyi type B flagellin and alpha toxin genes, but negative for Clostridium haemolyticum and other clostridia. Based on postmortem findings and ancillary tests, a definitive diagnosis of infectious necrotic hepatitis (INH) was made. Mostly a disease of ruminants, also known as black disease, INH has rarely been reported in horses, and a definitive etiologic diagnosis has not been achieved previously; the etiology of all cases reported to date was identified as C. novyi but the type was not determined. Animals are predisposed to clostridial hepatitis when hepatic anaerobiosis is established. Such conditions allow germination and proliferation of bacterial spores, resulting in production and release of toxins. INH, caused by C. novyi type B, and bacillary hemoglobinuria, caused by C. haemolyticum, are mechanistically and pathologically almost indistinguishable. Because these 2 microorganisms are closely related, differentiation requires molecular tools. "

For every death by suicide, an estimated 138 people’s lives are meaningfully affected, and almost any other statistic around suicide deaths is equally alarming. The pervasiveness of social media—and the near-ubiquity of mobile devices used to access social media networks—offers new types of data for understanding the behavior of those who (attempt to) take their own lives and suggests new possibilities for preventive intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of using social media data to detect those at risk for suicide. Specifically, we use natural language processing and machine learning (specifically deep learning) techniques to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and describe designs for an automated system for estimating suicide risk, usable by those without specialized mental health training (eg, a primary care doctor). We also discuss the ethical use of such technology and examine privacy implications. Currently, this technology is only used for intervention for individuals who have “opted in” for the analysis and intervention, but the technology enables scalable screening for suicide risk, potentially identifying many people who are at risk preventively and prior to any engagement with a health care system. This raises a significant cultural question about the trade-off between privacy and prevention—we have potentially life-saving technology that is currently reaching only a fraction of the possible people at risk because of respect for their privacy.

Paired serum and CSF were obtained within a few weeks from onset of AMON. CSF-restricted oligoclonal IgG bands, free kappa and free lambda chain bands were observed in 17, 15, and nine of 27 examined patients, respectively. Sixteen patients showed a polyspecific intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG antibodies against one or more viruses. At 1 year follow-up five patients had developed clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS); all had CSF oligoclonal IgG bands and virus-specific oligoclonal IgG antibodies at onset. Due to the relative small number studied at the short-term follow-up, no firm conclusion of the prognostic value of these analyses could be reached. CSF Myelin Basic Protein-like material was increased in only two of 29 patients with AMON, but may have potential value in reflecting disease activity, as the highest values were obtained among patients with CSF sampled soon after the worst visual acuity was reached, and among patients with severe visual impairment. In most previous studies of patients with AMON qualitative and quantitative analyses of CSF IgG had a predictive value for development of CDMS, but the results are conflicting. "

First, 78 experienced teachers of English as a second language / English as a foreign language (ESL/EFL) rated the usefulness of 973 non-overlapping items between the two lists for their learners. Second, 135 Vietnamese EFL learners completed 15 yes/no tests which measured their knowledge of the same 973 words. Teachers perceived that the BNC/COCA2000 had more useful words.

Studies which aim to derive appropriate weighting factors for these attributes through soliciting the perceived importance from experts are abundant. This article reports the findings of a study which, based on face-to-face interviews with 548 end users and 66 building professionals, processed their perceived importance of IEQ using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Attributes included were thermal comfort, air cleanliness, odor and noise associated with the air conditioning system of typical commercial buildings. Correlation analysis of the ranking results of the AHP weights revealed the difference in perceived importance of the attributes according to gender of the respondents. Other factors also found to have influence on the perceived importance of the IEQ were whether the respondents were professionals or other end users and the reason for them working or visiting the buildings and the duration of their stay. These all varied with psychophysical factors such as personal experiences, needs and expectations. Further work is needed to study whether the weighting factors should be derived from the perceptions of experts, end users, or a balance between the two. "

It highlights a fundamental contradiction that is present in the work of one of its most influential proponents, sociologist Mary Waters: the simultaneous affirmation and negation of the operation of choice in the making of ethnic identities, followed by the methodological neglect of the cultural production of identity. The article argues that this methodological oversight embeds symbolic ethnicity in a wider discourse on choice as a constitutive element of American identity. Also, it shows how the privileging of choice makes it possible to achieve a vision of American multiculturalism based on the dialectical synthesis of two historically competing ideologies: the concept of America as a melting pot and a cultural mosaic. Showing that symbolic ethnicity conflates culture, identity and ancestry, and noting that it undervalues the social valence of white ethnicity, the article concludes with a discussion of how to recover ethnic identity analytically as an enduring, politically significant disposition and practice."

This article reports on a study on the use of portable personal computing devices in the early years of schooling. Specifically, it focuses on emerging patterns of use of Apple iPads in an Australian Preparatory (first year of compulsory schooling) classroom during the first year of implementation of these devices. We draw on student and teacher interviews and classroom observation data to provide a research meta-narrative of the intentions, practices and reflections of a ‘first year out’ teacher, and to discuss points of tension found in the contested space of early years literacy education, which are highlighted when potentially transformative technologies meet institutionalized literacy education practices. Our findings suggest that the broader policy and curriculum context of early years literacy education, and institutionalized practices found in this space, is potentially at odds with teacher-held intentions to transform learning through technology use, particularly with respect to tensions between print-based traditions and new digital literacies, and those between standards-based classroom curricula and more emancipatory agendas.

Particularly in hazardous situations, such as a threatening collision, a driver must understand the warning immediately. For this reason, collision warnings should convey as much information as needed to interpret the situation properly and to prepare preventive actions. The present study investigated whether informing about the object and the location of an imminent crash by a multimodal warning (visual and auditory) leads to shorter reaction times and fewer collisions compared to warning signals which only inform about the object of the crash (auditory icons) or give no additional information (simple tone). Results reveal that multimodal warnings have the potential to produce a significant advantage over unimodal signals as long as their components complement each other in a way that realistically fits the situation at hand.

To explore the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and voluntary muscle contraction (VMC) to improve corticospinal transmission, muscle function, and purposeful movement early after stroke. Methods. Factorial 2 × 2 randomized single-blind trial. Subjects: n = 27, mean age 75 years, mean 27 days after middle cerebral artery infarct (24 subjects completed outcome measures). Procedure: after baseline measurement (day 1), subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 groups. Treatment was given for the next 8 working days, and outcome was measured on day 10. Interventions: (a) Real-rTMS + RealVMC, (b) Real-rTMS + PlaceboVMC, (c) Placebo-rTMS + RealVMC, and (d) Placebo-rTMS + PlaceboVMC. Real-rTMS consisted of 200 1-Hz stimuli at 120% motor threshold in 5 blocks of 40 separated by 3 minutes delivered to the lesioned hemisphere. Placebo-rTMS used a dummy coil. In RealVMC, the paretic elbow was repeatedly flexed/extended for 5 minutes. In PlaceboVMC, subjects viewed pairs of drawings of upper limbs and reported their likeness. Outcomes: frequency of motor-evoked potentials in biceps and triceps, muscle function (torque about elbow), and purposeful movement (Action Research Arm Test). Analysis: group mean changes (outcome — baseline) were compared. Results. In the Real-rTMS + RealVMC group, motor-evoked potential frequency increased 14% for biceps and 20% for triceps, whereas in the Placebo-rTMS + PlaceboVMC group, it decreased 12% for biceps and 6% for triceps. For other groups, there were changes of intermediate values. No meaningful differences were found for secondary outcomes. Conclusions .

Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the unaffected motor cortex may improve motor function of the paretic hand after stroke. However, low-frequency rTMS might adversely affect bimanual movement by decreasing transcallosal function. Objective. The authors investigated whether combined administration of rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) prevents deterioration of bimanual movement induced by low-frequency rTMS over the unaffected hemisphere. Methods. A total of 27 participants with chronic subcortical stroke were randomly assigned to receive either 1 Hz rTMS over the unaffected hemisphere, anodal tDCS over the affected hemisphere, or a combination of rTMS and tDCS. All patients performed a pinching motor-training task after stimulation. Bimanual movement and transcallosal inhibition (TCI) were evaluated after stimulation. Results. rTMS and rTMS-tDCS enhanced the motor training effect on the paretic hand. rTMS decreased bimanual coordination and reduced TCI from the unaffected to the affected hemisphere (TCI<jats:sub>unaff-aff</jats:sub>). rTMS-tDCS changed TCI balance of both hemispheres but did not affect bimanual coordination or TCI<jats:sub>unaff-aff</jats:sub>. The change in bimanual coordination was negatively correlated with TCI<jats:sub>unaff-aff</jats:sub>. Following stimulation, improvement in the pinch force in the paretic hand was negatively correlated with TCI balance. Conclusions. Inhibitory rTMS over the unaffected hemisphere transiently caused deterioration of bimanual movements for the current task in stroke patients. This short-term decline was prevented by combined administration of low-frequency rTMS over the unaffected hemisphere and anodal tDCS over the affected hemisphere. These responses to bihemispheric stimulation suggest possible caution and opportunities for the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke."

Seizure frequency, seizure days and epileptic discharges in the EEG obtained before, during and after stimulation were compared. The psychological conditions of all individual patients were evaluated with Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) before and after rTMS treatment.  Mean seizure frequencies per week significantly decreased in the following 4-week rTMS treatment period compared with the pretreatment period (14.09 vs. 5.63, p &lt; 0.05, mean reduction of 60.02% in seizure frequency). Mean seizure days per week during the treatment period and the post-treatment period were lower than that of the pretreatment period (5.18 vs. 2.99 p &lt; 0.05, mean reduction of 42.5% in seizure days). Mean epileptic discharges in the EEG decreased significantly during the treatment period compared to that of the pre-treatment period (78.60 vs. 66.09, p &lt; 0.05, mean reduction of 15.9% in epileptic spikes discharges) in all 17 patients.

We approach hashtags as sociotechnical formations that serve social media research not only as criteria in corpus selection but also displaying the complexity of the online engagement and its entanglement with the technicity of web platforms. Therefore, the study of hashtag engagement requires a grasping of the functioning of the platform itself (technicity) along with the platform grammatization. In this respect, we propose the three-layered (3L) perspective for addressing hashtag engagement. The first contemplates potential differences between high-visibility and ordinary hashtag usage culture, its related actors, and content. The second focuses on hashtagging activity and the repurposing of how hashtags can be differently embedded into social media databases. The last layer looks particularly into the images and texts to which hashtags are brought to relation. To operationalize the 3L framework, we draw on the case of the “impeachment-cum-coup” of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff.

               Cytogenetic abnormalities, evaluated either by karyotype or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are considered the most important prognostic factor in multiple myeloma (MM). However, there is no information about the prognostic impact of genomic changes detected by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). We have analyzed the frequency and prognostic impact of genetic changes as detected by CGH and evaluated the relationship between these chromosomal imbalances and IGH translocation, analyzed by FISH, in 74 patients with newly diagnosed MM. Genomic changes were identified in 51 (69%) of the 74 MM patients. The most recurrent abnormalities among the cases with genomic changes were gains on chromosome regions 1q (45%), 5q (24%), 9q (24%), 11q (22%), 15q (22%), 3q (16%), and 7q (14%), while losses mainly involved chromosomes 13 (39%), 16q (18%), 6q (10%), and 8p (10%). Remarkably, the 6 patients with gains on 11q had IGH translocations. Multivariate analysis selected chromosomal losses, 11q gains, age, and type of treatment (conventional chemotherapy vs autologous transplantation) as independent parameters for predicting survival. Genomic losses retained the prognostic value irrespective of treatment approach. According to these results, losses of chromosomal material evaluated by CGH represent a powerful prognostic factor in MM patients. (Blood. 2004;104:2661-2666)"

               The development of chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) in the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–negative metaphases during imatinib (IM) therapy in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myecloid leukemia (CML) has been reported only anecdotally. We assessed the frequency and significance of this phenomenon among 258 patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase receiving IM. After a median follow-up of 37 months, 21 (9%) patients developed 23 CAs in Ph-negative cells; excluding −Y, this incidence was 5%. Sixteen (70%) of all CAs were observed in 2 or more metaphases. The median time from start of IM to the appearance of CAs was 18 months. The most common CAs were −Y and + 8 in 9 and 3 patients, respectively. CAs were less frequent in young patients (P = .02) and those treated with high-dose IM (P = .03). In all but 3 patients, CAs were transient and disappeared after a median of 5 months. One patient developed acute myeloid leukemia (associated with − 7). At last follow-up, 3 patients died from transplantation-related complications, myocardial infarction, and progressive disease and 2 lost cytogenetic response. CAs occur in Ph-negative cells in a small percentage of patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with IM. In rare instances, these could reflect the emergence of a new malignant clone."

               Although cytogenetic abnormalities are important prognostic factors in myeloid malignancies, they are not included in current prognostic scores for primary myelofibrosis (PMF). To determine their relevance in PMF, we retrospectively examined the impact of cytogenetic abnormalities and karyotypic evolution on the outcome of 256 patients. Baseline cytogenetic status impacted significantly on survival: patients with favorable abnormalities (sole deletions in 13q or 20q, or trisomy 9 ± one other abnormality) had survivals similar to those with normal diploid karyotypes (median, 63 and 46 months, respectively), whereas patients with unfavorable abnormalities (rearrangement of chromosome 5 or 7, or ≥ 3 abnormalities) had a poor median survival of 15 months. Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 17 had a median survival of only 5 months. A model containing karyotypic abnormalities, hemoglobin, platelet count, and performance status effectively risk-stratified patients at initial evaluation. Among 73 patients assessable for clonal evolution during stable chronic phase, those who developed unfavorable or chromosome 17 abnormalities had median survivals of 18 and 9 months, respectively, suggesting the potential role of cytogenetics as a risk factor applicable at any time in the disease course. Dynamic prognostic significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in PMF should be further prospectively evaluated."

               Very little data have been published on cytogenetic abnormalities in Hodgkin's disease (HD) and their correlation with clinicopathologic features are scanty. We have performed chromosomal analysis of lymph nodes from 60 previously untreated HD patients and obtained analyzable metaphases in 49 patients (82%). Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 33 patients (55%) but only 31 karyotypes could be, at least partially, described. Twenty-nine cases showed numerical abnormalities that involved all chromosomes with the exception of chromosomes 13 and Y, which were gained less frequently and lost more frequently than other chromosomes. Structural abnormalities were found in 30 cases, involving all chromosomes except Y. Chromosomal regions 12p11–13, 13p11– 13, 3q26–28, 6q15–16, and 7q31–35 were rearranged in more than 20% of the analyzable cases. No correlation was found between cytogenetic findings and initial characteristics. When compared with diffuse B-cell lymphomas, defects in regions 2p25 (P less than .01), 12p11–13 (P less than .01), 13p11–13 (P less than .01), 14p11 (P less than .01), 15p11– 13 (P less than .02), and 20q12–13 (P less than .05) were more frequent in HD. When compared with T-cell lymphomas, only defects in regions 12p12–13 (P less than .01) and 13p11–13 (P less than .01) were more frequent in HD. Failure to obtain analyzable metaphases was correlated with stage IV of the disease (P less than .05) and with a poor survival (P less than .01), but cytogenetic results showed no other correlation with clinical outcome. We conclude that molecular studies in HD should be focused on the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 13. Determination of the clinical significance of cytogenetic findings will require a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period."

               Background: Previous cytogenetic studies in polycythemia vera (PV) have included a relatively small number of patients (“n” ranging 10–64). In the current study (n=137), we describe cytogenetic findings at presentation and examine their relationship to clinical and laboratory features, including bone marrow JAK2V617F allele burden.
               Methods: The study consisted of a consecutive group of patients with PV who fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and in whom bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic studies were performed at diagnosis.
               Results I: cytogenetic details At diagnosis: A total of 137 patients (median age, 64 years; 49% females) were studied at diagnosis and had adequate metaphases for interpretation. Cytogenetics were normal in 117 patients (85%) and displayed either a sole -Y abnormality in 5 patients (7% of the male patients), and other chromosomal abnormalities in 15 (11%). The latter included trisomy 8 in five patients, trisomy 9 in three patients, two patients each with del(13q), del(20q), and abnormalities of chromosome 1, and one patient each with del(3)(p13p21), dup(13)(q12q14), and del(11)(q21). At follow-up: Repeat cytogenetic studies while still in the chronic phase of the disease were performed in 19 patients at a median of 60 months (range, 8–198) from diagnosis. Of these, 4 had aquired new cytogenetic clones including 3 with normal cytogenetics at time of initial PV diagnosis. The new abnormalities included del(20q), del(5q), del(1p), chromosome 1 abnormality, and inv(3)(q21q26.2). At time of disease transformation: Leukemic transformation was documented in 3 patients of whom cytogenetic information at the time was available in 2 patients; both patients had normal results at time of initial PV diagnosis and complex cytogenetic abnormalities at time of leukemic transformation. In contrast, among 6 patients with available cytogenetic information at time of fibrotic transformation, the results were unchanged from those obtained at time of diagnosis in 5 patients. ii) Correlation between cytogenetics at diagnosis and JAK2V617F allele burden: Allele-specific, quantitative PCR analysis for JAK2V617F was performed in 71 patients using genomic DNA from archived bone marrow obtained at the time of the initial cytogenetic studies. JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 64 of the 71 (90%) patients; median mutant allele burden was 16% (range 3–80%) without significant difference among the different cytogenetic groups: normal vs. –Y vs. other cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.72). iii) Clinical correlates and prognostic relevance of cytogenetic findings at diagnosis: Among several parameters studied for significant correlations with cytogenetic findings at diagnosis, an association was evident only for age (p=0.02); all –Y abnormalities (n=5) as well as 13 of the 15 (87%) other cytogenetic abnormalities occurred in patients ≥ 60 years of age. Stated another way, the incidence of abnormal cytogenetics (other than -Y) was 4% for patients younger than age 60 years and 15% otherwise. The presence of abnormal cytogenetics at diagnosis had no significant impact on either overall or leukemia-free survival.
               Conclusions: Abnormal cytogenetic findings at diagnosis are infrequent in PV, especially in patients below age 60 years. Furthermore, their clinical relevance is limited and there is not significant correlation with bone marrow JAK2V617F allele burden."

               This paper reports the results of cytogenetic studies in a consecutive series of 64 patients with polycythemia vera, 57 of whom could be followed prospectively. The median length of the cytogenetic observation time was 93 months (range, 24 to 224 months) after diagnosis. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed initially in 11 patients (17%) and later during the course of the disease in another 20 patients. An abnormal karyotype was found in 71% to 80% of the patients who were examined after the development of myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis, or leukemia. Patients treated with myelosuppressive agents showed a significantly greater risk of chromosome abnormalities developing than did patients who had been phlebotomized. Acute leukemia developed in eight patients, all of whom had been treated with myelosuppressive agents. A chromosome abnormality preceded the leukemia in only two of the patients. The initial presence of an abnormal karyotype did not predict a greater risk of development of leukemia. No consistent relationship was demonstrated between the occurrence of chromosome abnormalities and the development of myeloid metaplasia and/or myelofibrosis, which was observed in 42% of the patients. The chromosome abnormalities followed a nonrandom pattern, and those most frequently observed were trisomies for 1 q, 8, 9, or 9p and deletion of 20q. Deletions seem to be common and were found in 14 patients."

The most frequent abnormal findings were a 20q- deletion in six cases (either alone or within complex anomalies), interstitial 13q- deletion in three cases (and monosomy 13 in one case), and acquired trisomy 21 or 21p+ in three cases. Four cases exhibited complex aberrations involving several chromosomes, sometimes with a mosaicism. In two patients with an initial abnormal karyotype, further cytogenetic analysis during the disease course showed the appearance of additional clonal anomalies, and particularly of a probable Philadelphia (Ph1) variant in one case. Treatment was essentially supportive. Survival was significantly shorter in group II (median, 30 months) compared with group I (median, not reached at 6 years; P = .015). In univariate analysis, other parameters significantly associated with a poor prognosis (P less than .05) were higher age, anemia, and increased percentage of circulating blasts.

The cytogenetic method used was a 24- to 48-hour culture, followed by G- banding. Several significant associations were discovered. A trisomy 3 was correlated with high-grade NHL. In the patients with an immunoblastic NHL, an abnormal chromosome no. 3 or 6 was found significantly more frequently. As previously described, a t(14;18) was significantly correlated with a follicular growth pattern. Abnormalities on chromosome no. 17 were correlated with a diffuse histology and a shorter survival. A shorter survival was also correlated with a +5, +6, +18, all abnormalities on chromosome no. 5, or involvement of breakpoint 14q11–12. In a multivariate analysis, these chromosomal abnormalities appeared to be independent prognostic factors and correlated with survival more strongly than any traditional prognostic variable. Patients with a t(11;14)(q13;q32) had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Skin infiltration was correlated with abnormalities on 2p. Abnormalities involving breakpoints 6q11–16 were correlated with B symptoms. Patients with abnormalities involving breakpoints 3q21–25 and 13q21–24 had more frequent bulky disease. The correlations of certain clinical findings with specific chromosomal abnormalities might help unveil the pathogenetic mechanisms of NHL and tailor treatment regimens."

An abnormal karyotype (32 cases of 94 tested patients) was associated with a short survival, especially in the low-risk group (median survival of 50 v 112 months in patients with normal karyotype). The prognostic factors for acute conversion were WBC &gt; 30 x 10(3)/L and abnormal karyotype. Thus, hemoglobin level and leukocyte count provide a simple prognostic model for survival in AMM, and the adverse prognostic value of abnormal karyotype may be related to a higher rate of acute conversion."

The leukemogenic risk associated to treatment with hydroxyurea in ET, on the other hand, is generally considered to be relatively low. Between 1970 and 1991, we diagnosed ET in 357 patients, who were monitored until 1996. One or several therapeutic agents had been admistered to 326 patients, including hydroxyurea (HU) in 251 (as only treatment in 201), pipobroman in 43, busulfan in 41, and32P in 40. With a median follow-up duration of 98 months, 17 patients (4.5%) had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML; six cases) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 11 cases). Fourteen of these patients had received HU, as sole treatment in seven cases, and preceded or followed by other treatment in seven cases, mainly pipobroman (five cases). The remaining three leukemic progressions occurred in patients treated with 32P (two cases) and busulfan (one case). The incidence of AML and MDS after treatment, using 32P alone and 32P with other agents, busulfan alone and with other agents, HU alone and with others agents, and pipobroman alone and with other agents was 7% and 9%, 3% and 17%, 3.5% and 14%, and 0% and 16%, respectively. Thirteen of 17 patients who progressed to AML or MDS had successful cytogenetic analysis. Seven of them had rearrangements of chromosome 17 (unbalanced translocation, partial or complete deletion, isochromosome 17q) that resulted in 17p deletion. They also had a typical form of dysgranulopoiesis combining pseudo Pelger Hüet hypolobulation and vacuoles in neutrophils, and p53 mutation, as previously described in AML and MDS with 17p deletion. Those seven patients had all received HU, as the only therapeutic agent in three, and followed by pipobroman in three. The three patients who had received no HU and progressed to AML or MDS had no 17p deletion. A review of the literature found cytogenetic analysis in 35 cases of AML and MDS occurring after ET, 11 of whom had been treated with HU alone. Five of 35 patients had rearrangements that resulted in 17p deletion. Four of them had been treated with HU alone. These results show that treatment with HU alone is associated with a leukemic risk of approximately 3.5%. A high proportion of AML and MDS occurring in ET treated with HU (alone or possibly followed by pipobroman) have morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of the 17p− syndrome. These findings suggest that widespread and prolonged use of HU in ET may have to be reconsidered in some situations, such as asymptomatic ET."

However, many studies on which this assertion is based were limited by relatively small sample sizes or varying treatment approach, leading to conflicting data regarding the prognostic implications of specific cytogenetic abnormalities. The Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial, which included children and adults up to 55 years of age, not only affords the opportunity to determine the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics in the context of large patient groups receiving comparable therapy, but also to address their impact on the outcome of subsequent transplantation procedures performed in first complete remission (CR). On the basis of response to induction treatment, relapse risk, and overall survival, three prognostic groups could be defined by cytogenetic abnormalities detected at presentation in comparison with the outcome of patients with normal karyotype. AML associated with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16) predicted a relatively favorable outcome. Whereas in patients lacking these favorable changes, the presence of a complex karyotype, −5, del(5q), −7, or abnormalities of 3q defined a group with relatively poor prognosis. The remaining group of patients including those with 11q23 abnormalities, +8, +21, +22, del(9q), del(7q) or other miscellaneous structural or numerical defects not encompassed by the favorable or adverse risk groups were found to have an intermediate prognosis. The presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities did not modify the outcome of patients with favorable cytogenetics. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the three cytogenetically defined prognostic groups retained their predictive value in the context of secondary as well as de novo AML, within the pediatric age group and furthermore were found to be a key determinant of outcome from autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first CR. This study highlights the importance of diagnostic cytogenetics as an independent prognostic factor in AML, providing the framework for a stratified treatment approach of this disease, which has been adopted in the current MRC AML 12 trial."

               Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, and implementation of risk-adapted therapy has been instrumental in the dramatic improvements in clinical outcomes. A key to risk-adapted therapies includes the identification of genomic features of individual tumors, including chromosome number (for hyper- and hypodiploidy) and gene fusions, notably ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and BCR-ABL1 in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of large ALL cohorts has expanded the number of recurrent gene fusions recognized as drivers in ALL, and identification of these new entities will contribute to refining ALL risk stratification. We used RNA-seq on 126 ALL patients from our clinical service to test the utility of including RNA-seq in standard-of-care diagnostic pipelines to detect gene rearrangements and IKZF1 deletions. RNA-seq identified 86% of rearrangements detected by standard-of-care diagnostics. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements, although usually identified, were the most commonly missed by RNA-seq as a result of low expression. RNA-seq identified rearrangements that were not detected by standard-of-care testing in 9 patients. These were found in patients who were not classifiable using standard molecular assessment. We developed an approach to detect the most common IKZF1 deletion from RNA-seq data and validated this using an RQ-PCR assay. We applied an expression classifier to identify Philadelphia chromosome–like B-ALL patients. T-ALL proved a rich source of novel gene fusions, which have clinical implications or provide insights into disease biology. Our experience shows that RNA-seq can be implemented within an individual clinical service to enhance the current molecular diagnostic risk classification of ALL."

            Fpocket is an open source pocket detection package based on Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres built on top of the publicly available package Qhull. The modular source code is organised around a central library of functions, a basis for three main programs: (i) Fpocket, to perform pocket identification, (ii) Tpocket, to organise pocket detection benchmarking on a set of known protein-ligand complexes, and (iii) Dpocket, to collect pocket descriptor values on a set of proteins. Fpocket is written in the C programming language, which makes it a platform well suited for the scientific community willing to develop new scoring functions and extract various pocket descriptors on a large scale level. Fpocket 1.0, relying on a simple scoring function, is able to detect 94% and 92% of the pockets within the best three ranked pockets from the holo and apo proteins respectively, outperforming the standards of the field, while being faster.

As events are usually centred on verbs and nominalised verbs, understanding the syntactic and semantic behaviour of these words is highly important.

Using the scheme, we have created the Gene Regulation Event Corpus (GREC), consisting of 240 MEDLINE abstracts, in which events relating to gene regulation and expression have been annotated by biologists. A novel method of evaluating various different facets of the annotation task showed that average inter-annotator agreement rates fall within the range of 66% - 90%.

            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            The GREC is a unique resource within the biomedical field, in that it annotates not only core relationships between entities, but also a range of other important details about these relationships, e.g., location, temporal, manner and environmental conditions. As such, it is specifically designed to support bio-specific tool and resource development. It has already been used to acquire semantic frames for inclusion within the <jats:italic>BioLexicon</jats:italic> (a lexical, terminological resource to aid biomedical text mining). Initial experiments have also shown that the corpus may viably be used to train IE components, such as semantic role labellers. The corpus and annotation guidelines are freely available for academic purposes.

            In this paper we describe an open-source species name recognition and normalization software system, LINNAEUS, and evaluate its performance relative to several automatically generated biomedical corpora, as well as a novel corpus of full-text documents manually annotated for species mentions. LINNAEUS uses a dictionary-based approach (implemented as an efficient deterministic finite-state automaton) to identify species names and a set of heuristics to resolve ambiguous mentions. When compared against our manually annotated corpus, LINNAEUS performs with 94% recall and 97% precision at the mention level, and 98% recall and 90% precision at the document level. Our system successfully solves the problem of disambiguating uncertain species mentions, with 97% of all mentions in PubMed Central full-text documents resolved to unambiguous NCBI taxonomy identifiers.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation for experimental observations called 'Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design' (KEfED) based on experimental variables and their interdependencies. The software has three parts: (a) the KEfED model editor - a design editor for creating KEfED models by drawing a flow diagram of an experimental protocol; (b) the KEfED data interface - a spreadsheet-like tool that permits users to enter experimental data pertaining to a specific model; (c) a 'neural connection matrix' interface that presents neural connectivity as a table of ordinal connection strengths representing the interpretations of tract-tracing data. This tool also allows the user to view experimental evidence pertaining to a specific connection. BioScholar is built in Flex 3.5. It uses Persevere (a <jats:italic>noSQL</jats:italic> database) as a flexible data store and PowerLoom<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> (a mature First Order Logic reasoning system) to execute queries using spatial reasoning over the BAMS neuroanatomical ontology.

We then describe the design and implementation of our example application: the BioScholar software. This is presented as a possible biocuration interface and supplementary reasoning toolkit for a larger, more specialized bioinformatics system: the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS).

            Biology-focused databases and software define bioinformatics and their use is central to computational biology. In such a complex and dynamic field, it is of interest to understand what resources are available, which are used, how much they are used, and for what they are used. While scholarly literature surveys can provide some insights, large-scale computer-based approaches to identify mentions of bioinformatics databases and software from primary literature would automate systematic cataloguing, facilitate the monitoring of usage, and provide the foundations for the recovery of computational methods for analysing biological data, with the long-term aim of identifying best/common practice in different areas of biology.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            We have developed bioNerDS, a named entity recogniser for the recovery of bioinformatics databases and software from primary literature. We identify such entities with an F-measure ranging from 63% to 91% at the mention level and 63-78% at the document level, depending on corpus. Not attaining a higher F-measure is mostly due to high ambiguity in resource naming, which is compounded by the on-going introduction of new resources. To demonstrate the software, we applied bioNerDS to full-text articles from BMC Bioinformatics and Genome Biology. General mention patterns reflect the remit of these journals, highlighting BMC Bioinformatics’s emphasis on new tools and Genome Biology’s greater emphasis on data analysis. The data also illustrates some shifts in resource usage: for example, the past decade has seen R and the Gene Ontology join BLAST and GenBank as the main components in bioinformatics processing.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            The goal of the first BioCreAtIvE challenge (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology) was to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for text mining applied to biological problems. The results were presented in a workshop held in Granada, Spain March 28–31, 2004. The articles collected in this <jats:italic>BMC Bioinformatics</jats:italic> supplement entitled ""A critical assessment of text mining methods in molecular biology"" describe the BioCreAtIvE tasks, systems, results and their independent evaluation.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            BioCreAtIvE focused on two tasks. The first dealt with extraction of gene or protein names from text, and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism databases (fly, mouse, yeast). The second task addressed issues of functional annotation, requiring systems to identify specific text passages that supported Gene Ontology annotations for specific proteins, given full text articles.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            The first BioCreAtIvE assessment achieved a high level of international participation (27 groups from 10 countries). The assessment provided state-of-the-art performance results for a basic task (gene name finding and normalization), where the best systems achieved a balanced 80% precision / recall or better, which potentially makes them suitable for real applications in biology. The results for the advanced task (functional annotation from free text) were significantly lower, demonstrating the current limitations of text-mining approaches where knowledge extrapolation and interpretation are required. In addition, an important contribution of BioCreAtIvE has been the creation and release of training and test data sets for both tasks. There are 22 articles in this special issue, including six that provide analyses of results or data quality for the data sets, including a novel inter-annotator consistency assessment for the test set used in task 2.

This paper summarizes the BioCreAtIvE task 1B, the ""Normalized Gene List"" task, which was inspired by the gene list supplied for each curated paper in a model organism database. The task was to produce the correct list of unique gene identifiers for the genes and gene products mentioned in sets of abstracts from three model organisms (Yeast, Fly, and Mouse).

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            Eight groups fielded systems for three data sets (Yeast, Fly, and Mouse). For Yeast, the top scoring system (out of 15) achieved 0.92 F-measure (harmonic mean of precision and recall); for Mouse and Fly, the task was more difficult, due to larger numbers of genes, more ambiguity in the gene naming conventions (particularly for Fly), and complex gene names (for Mouse). For Fly, the top F-measure was 0.82 out of 11 systems and for Mouse, it was 0.79 out of 16 systems.

            This assessment demonstrates that multiple groups were able to perform a real biological task across a range of organisms. The performance was dependent on the organism, and specifically on the naming conventions associated with each organism. These results hold out promise that the technology can provide partial automation of the curation process in the near future.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            Molecular Biology accumulated substantial amounts of data concerning functions of genes and proteins. Information relating to functional descriptions is generally extracted manually from textual data and stored in biological databases to build up annotations for large collections of gene products. Those annotation databases are crucial for the interpretation of large scale analysis approaches using bioinformatics or experimental techniques. Due to the growing accumulation of functional descriptions in biomedical literature the need for text mining tools to facilitate the extraction of such annotations is urgent. In order to make text mining tools useable in real world scenarios, for instance to assist database curators during annotation of protein function, comparisons and evaluations of different approaches on full text articles are needed.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            The Critical Assessment for Information Extraction in Biology (BioCreAtIvE) contest consists of a community wide competition aiming to evaluate different strategies for text mining tools, as applied to biomedical literature. We report on task two which addressed the automatic extraction and assignment of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of human proteins, using full text articles. The predictions of task 2 are based on triplets of <jats:italic>protein – GO term – article passage</jats:italic>. The annotation-relevant text passages were returned by the participants and evaluated by expert curators of the GO annotation (GOA) team at the European Institute of Bioinformatics (EBI). Each participant could submit up to three results for each sub-task comprising task 2. In total more than 15,000 individual results were provided by the participants. The curators evaluated in addition to the annotation itself, whether the protein and the GO term were correctly predicted and traceable through the submitted text fragment.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            Concepts provided by GO are currently the most extended set of terms used for annotating gene products, thus they were explored to assess how effectively text mining tools are able to extract those annotations automatically. Although the obtained results are promising, they are still far from reaching the required performance demanded by real world applications. Among the principal difficulties encountered to address the proposed task, were the complex nature of the GO terms and protein names (the large range of variants which are used to express proteins and especially GO terms in free text), and the lack of a standard training set. A range of very different strategies were used to tackle this task. The dataset generated in line with the BioCreative challenge is publicly available and will allow new possibilities for training information extraction methods in the domain of molecular biology.

            The biological research literature is a major repository of knowledge. As the amount of literature increases, it will get harder to find the information of interest on a particular topic. There has been an increasing amount of work on text mining this literature, but comparing this work is hard because of a lack of standards for making comparisons. To address this, we worked with colleagues at the Protein Design Group, CNB-CSIC, Madrid to develop BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment for Information Extraction in Biology), an open common evaluation of systems on a number of biological text mining tasks. We report here on task 1A, which deals with finding mentions of genes and related entities in text. ""Finding mentions"" is a basic task, which can be used as a building block for other text mining tasks. The task makes use of data and evaluation software provided by the (US) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

            Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step for text mining the biomedical literature. Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus. The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names. We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            To ensure heterogeneity of the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term similarity to documents with known gene names, and 10K high- and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger, and the results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true meaning in the sentence context. Application of these constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial matching.

          <jats:sec>

            The annotation of GENETAG required intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered tagging consistency.

Following an iterative process through which all specimens belonging to taxa with anomalous divergence values and/or monophyly issues were re-examined, identity was modified for 9 taxa, including the reinstatement of <jats:italic>Phaonia luteva</jats:italic> (Walker) <jats:bold>stat. nov.</jats:bold> as a species distinct from <jats:italic>Phaonia errans</jats:italic> (Meigen). In the post-reassessment data set, no distinct gap was found between maximum pairwise intraspecific distances (range 0.00-3.01%) and minimum interspecific distances (range: 0.77-11.33%). Nevertheless, using a clustering-based approach, all individuals within 98% of species grouped with their conspecifics with high (&gt;95%) bootstrap support; in contrast, a maximum species discrimination rate of 90% was obtained at the optimal threshold of 1.2%. DNA barcoding enabled the determination of females from 5 ambiguous species pairs and confirmed that 16 morphospecies were genetically distinct from named taxa. There were morphological differences among all distinct genetic clusters; thus, no cases of cryptic species were detected.

            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
            Our findings reveal the great utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference barcode database against which to compare unknowns. When such a library is unavailable, it is still possible to obtain a fairly accurate (within ~10%) rapid assessment of species richness based upon a barcode divergence threshold alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon.

            Evaluating the features and performance of health information systems can serve to strengthen the systems themselves as well as to guide other organizations in the process of designing and implementing surveillance tools. We adapted an evaluation framework in order to assess electronic immunization data collection systems, and applied it in two Ontario public health units.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <jats:italic>Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems</jats:italic> are broad in nature and serve as an organizational tool to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation materials. Based on these <jats:italic>Guidelines,</jats:italic> and informed by other evaluation resources and input from stakeholders in the public health community, we applied an evaluation framework to two examples of immunization data collection and examined several system attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, timeliness, and acceptability. Data collection approaches included key informant interviews, logic and completeness assessments, client surveys, and on-site observations.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            Both evaluated systems allow high-quality immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion. However, neither system is currently able to link to other providers’ immunization data or provincial data sources, limiting the comprehensiveness of coverage assessments. We recommended that both organizations explore possibilities for external data linkage and collaborate with other jurisdictions to promote a provincial immunization repository or data sharing platform.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            The invasive <jats:italic>Chondrostoma nasus nasus</jats:italic> has colonized part of the distribution area of the protected endemic species <jats:italic>Chondrostoma toxostoma toxostoma</jats:italic>. This hybrid zone is a complex system where multiple effects such as inter-species competition, bi-directional introgression, strong environmental pressure and so on are combined. Why do sympatric <jats:italic>Chondrostoma</jats:italic> fish present a unidirectional change in body shape? Is this the result of inter-species interactions and/or a response to environmental effects or the result of trade-offs? Studies focusing on the understanding of a trade-off between multiple parameters are still rare. Although this has previously been done for Cichlid species flock and for Darwin finches, where mouth or beak morphology were coupled to diet and genetic identification, no similar studies have been done for a fish hybrid zone in a river. We tested the correlation between morphology (body and mouth morphology), diet (stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes) and genomic combinations in different allopatric and sympatric populations for a global data set of 1330 specimens. To separate the species interaction effect from the environmental effect in sympatry, we distinguished two data sets: the first one was obtained from a highly regulated part of the river and the second was obtained from specimens coming from the less regulated part.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            The distribution of the hybrid combinations was different in the two part of the sympatric zone, whereas all the specimens presented similar overall changes in body shape and in mouth morphology. Sympatric specimens were also characterized by a larger diet behavior variance than reference populations, characteristic of an opportunistic diet. No correlation was established between the body shape (or mouth deformation) and the stable isotope signature.

            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
            The Durance River is an untamed Mediterranean river despite the presence of numerous dams that split the river from upstream to downstream. The sympatric effect on morphology and the large diet behavior range can be explained by a tendency toward an opportunistic behavior of the sympatric specimens. Indeed, the similar response of the two species and their hybrids implied an adaptation that could be defined as an alternative trade-off that underline the importance of epigenetics mechanisms for potential success in a novel environment.

            Both low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and intensive occupational therapy (OT) have been recently reported to be clinically beneficial for post-stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis. Based on these reports, we developed an inpatient combination protocol of these two modalities for the treatment of such patients. The aims of this pilot study were to confirm the safety and feasibility of the protocol in a large number of patients from different institutions, and identify predictors of the clinical response to the treatment.

            The study subjects were 204 post-stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis (mean age at admission 58.5 ± 13.4 years, mean time after stroke 5.0 ± 4.5 years, ± SD) from five institutions in Japan. During 15-day hospitalization, each patient received 22 treatment sessions of 20-min low-frequency rTMS and 120-min intensive OT daily. Low-frequency rTMS of 1 Hz was applied to the contralesional hemisphere over the primary motor area. The intensive OT, consisting of 60-min one-to-one training and 60-min self-exercise, was provided after the application of low-frequency rTMS. Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) were performed serially. The physiatrists and occupational therapists involved in this study received training prior to the study to standardize the therapeutic protocol.

The section of the tumor extending from the mucosa to submucosa of the duodenum was sharply demarcated, solid, and white-yellowish. Neither necrosis nor hemorrhage was present. Histological examination confirmed the immunohistochemical identification of three components comprising epithelioid cells, spindle-shaped cells, and ganglion-like cells. Epithelioid cells showed positive reactivity for synaptophysin, somatostatin, and CD56. In contrast, spindle-shaped cells showed positive reactivity for S-100 protein, but not for synaptophysin, somatostatin or CD56. Furthermore, we found lymph node metastasis despite lack of bcl-2 and p53 expression. In addition to the rarity of the tumor, we are describing here the present case suggests the malignant potency of the tumor despite lack of acceptable prognostic indicators for neuroendocrine tumor."

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                Current approaches to identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs), include safety studies during drug development and post-marketing surveillance after approval, offer important opportunities to identify potential safety issues, but are unable to provide complete set of all possible DDIs. Thus, the drug discovery researchers and healthcare professionals might not be fully aware of potentially dangerous DDIs. Predicting potential drug-drug interaction helps reduce unanticipated drug interactions and drug development costs and optimizes the drug design process. Methods for prediction of DDIs have the tendency to report high accuracy but still have little impact on translational research due to systematic biases induced by networked/paired data. In this work, we aimed to present realistic evaluation settings to predict DDIs using knowledge graph embeddings. We propose a simple disjoint cross-validation scheme to evaluate drug-drug interaction predictions for the scenarios where the drugs have no known DDIs.
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                We designed different evaluation settings to accurately assess the performance for predicting DDIs. The settings for disjoint cross-validation produced lower performance scores, as expected, but still were good at predicting the drug interactions. We have applied Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest on DrugBank knowledge graph with the 10-fold traditional cross validation using RDF2Vec, TransE and TransD. RDF2Vec with Skip-Gram generally surpasses other embedding methods. We also tested RDF2Vec on various drug knowledge graphs such as DrugBank, PharmGKB and KEGG to predict unknown drug-drug interactions. The performance was not enhanced significantly when an integrated knowledge graph including these three datasets was used.
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                We showed that the knowledge embeddings are powerful predictors and comparable to current state-of-the-art methods for inferring new DDIs. We addressed the evaluation biases by introducing drug-wise and pairwise disjoint test classes. Although the performance scores for drug-wise and pairwise disjoint seem to be low, the results can be considered to be realistic in predicting the interactions for drugs with limited interaction information.

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                In recent years, biomedical ontologies have become important for describing existing biological knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs. Data mining approaches that work with knowledge graphs have been proposed, but they are based on vector representations that do not capture the full underlying semantics. An alternative is to use machine learning approaches that explore semantic similarity. However, since ontologies can model multiple perspectives, semantic similarity computations for a given learning task need to be fine-tuned to account for this. Obtaining the best combination of semantic similarity aspects for each learning task is not trivial and typically depends on expert knowledge.
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                We have developed a novel approach, evoKGsim, that applies Genetic Programming over a set of semantic similarity features, each based on a semantic aspect of the data, to obtain the best combination for a given supervised learning task. The approach was evaluated on several benchmark datasets for protein-protein interaction prediction using the Gene Ontology as the knowledge graph to support semantic similarity, and it outperformed competing strategies, including manually selected combinations of semantic aspects emulating expert knowledge. evoKGsim was also able to learn species-agnostic models with different combinations of species for training and testing, effectively addressing the limitations of predicting protein-protein interactions for species with fewer known interactions.

                evoKGsim can overcome one of the limitations in knowledge graph-based semantic similarity applications: the need to expertly select which aspects should be taken into account for a given application. Applying this methodology to protein-protein interaction prediction proved successful, paving the way to broader applications.

                Accurately recognizing rare diseases based on symptom description is an important task in patient triage, early risk stratification, and target therapies. However, due to the very nature of rare diseases, the lack of historical data poses a great challenge to machine learning-based approaches. On the other hand, medical knowledge in automatically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs) has the potential to compensate the lack of labeled training examples. This work aims to develop a rare disease classification algorithm that makes effective use of a knowledge graph, even when the graph is imperfect.

We use two Chinese disease diagnosis corpora to evaluate the algorithm. The first one, HaoDaiFu, contains 51,374 chief complaints categorized into 805 diseases.

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
To facilitate the investigation of the pathogenic roles played by various immune cells in complex tissues such as tumors, a few computational methods for deconvoluting bulk gene expression profiles to predict cell composition have been created. However, available methods were usually developed along with a set of reference gene expression profiles consisting of imbalanced replicates across different cell types. Therefore, the objective of this study was to create a new deconvolution method equipped with a new set of reference gene expression profiles that incorporate more microarray replicates of the immune cells that have been frequently implicated in the poor prognosis of cancers, such as T helper cells, regulatory T cells and macrophage M1/M2 cells.

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                A One Health approach has been increasingly mainstreamed by the international community, as it provides for holistic thinking in recognizing the close links and inter-dependence of the health of humans, animals and the environment. However, the dearth of real-world evidence has hampered application of a One Health approach in shaping policies and practice. This study proposes the development of a potential evaluation tool for One Health performance, in order to contribute to the scientific measurement of One Health approach and the identification of gaps where One Health capacity building is most urgently needed.

                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                We describe five steps towards a global One Health index (GOHI), including (i) framework formulation; (ii) indicator selection; (iii) database building; (iv) weight determination; and (v) GOHI scores calculation. A cell-like framework for GOHI is proposed, which comprises an external drivers index (EDI), an intrinsic drivers index (IDI) and a core drivers index (CDI). We construct the indicator scheme for GOHI based on this framework after multiple rounds of panel discussions with our expert advisory committee. A fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is adopted to determine the weights for each of the indicators.
              </jats:sec><jats:sec>
                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                The weighted indicator scheme of GOHI comprises three first-level indicators, 13 second-level indicators, and 57 third-level indicators. According to the pilot analysis based on the data from more than 200 countries/territories the GOHI scores overall are far from ideal (the highest score of 65.0 out of a maximum score of 100), and we found considerable variations among different countries/territories (31.8–65.0). The results from the pilot analysis are consistent with the results from a literature review, which suggests that a GOHI as a potential tool for the assessment of One Health performance might be feasible.

                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
                GOHI—subject to rigorous validation—would represent the world’s first evaluation tool that constructs the conceptual framework from a holistic perspective of One Health. Future application of GOHI might promote a common understanding of a strong One Health approach and provide reference for promoting effective measures to strengthen One Health capacity building. With further adaptations under various scenarios, GOHI, along with its technical protocols and databases, will be updated regularly to address current technical limitations, and capture new knowledge.

However, an efficient a priori sampling of the design space rapidly becomes costly when using High-Fidelity (HF) simulators, especially in high dimension. On the other hand, in applications such as aeronautical design, multiple simulation tools are frequently available for the same problem, generally with a degree of precision inversely proportional to the CPU cost. Thus, the concept of multi-fidelity proposes to merge different levels of fidelity within a single model with controlled variance. Based on recent Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) techniques, an alternative approach allows to pursue the objective of mastering the simulation budget by replacing costly models with their approximate full-field counterparts, providing additional insight to scalar surrogates built directly from the Quantities of Interest (QoI). Both approaches: multi-fidelity and ROM, may be combined, allowing for additional flexibility in choosing the degree of fidelity required in different zones of the design space. This paper reviews the strategies that seek to improve surrogate-based optimization efficiency, including ROM, multi-fidelity metamodeling, and DOE enrichment strategies."

Recent meta-analysis demonstrated the potential link between ALDH2*2 mutation and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Other studies have linked chronic alcohol consumption as a risk factor for AD. In the present study, we show that fibroblasts of an AD patient that also has an ALDH2*2 mutation or overexpression of ALDH2*2 in fibroblasts derived from AD patients harboring ApoE ε4 allele exhibited increased aldehydic load, oxidative stress, and increased mitochondrial dysfunction relative to healthy subjects and exposure to ethanol exacerbated these dysfunctions. In an in vivo model, daily exposure of WT mice to ethanol for 11 weeks resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increased aldehyde levels in their brains and these pathologies were greater in ALDH2*2/*2 (homozygous) mice. Following chronic ethanol exposure, the levels of the AD-associated protein, amyloid-β, and neuroinflammation were higher in the brains of the ALDH2*2/*2 mice relative to WT. Cultured primary cortical neurons of ALDH2*2/*2 mice showed increased sensitivity to ethanol and there was a greater activation of their primary astrocytes relative to the responses of neurons or astrocytes from the WT mice. Importantly, an activator of ALDH2 and ALDH2*2, Alda-1, blunted the ethanol-induced increases in Aβ, and the neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that impairment in the metabolism of aldehydes, and specifically ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, is a contributor to AD associated pathology and highlights the likely risk of alcohol consumption in the general population and especially in East Asians that carry ALDH2*2 mutation."

The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT autonomy) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived autonomy was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance."

These knowledge graphs are typically enormous and are often not easily accessible to end-users because they require specialized knowledge in query languages such as SPARQL. Moreover, end-users need a deep understanding of the structure of the underlying data models often based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This drawback has led to the development of Question-Answering (QA) systems that enable end-users to express their information needs in natural language. While existing systems simplify user access, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of these systems. In this paper we propose a new QA system for translating natural language questions into SPARQL queries. The key idea is to break up the translation process into 5 smaller, more manageable sub-tasks and use ensemble machine learning methods as well as Tree-LSTM-based neural network models to automatically learn and translate a natural language question into a SPARQL query. The performance of our proposed QA system is empirically evaluated using the two renowned benchmarks-the 7th Question Answering over Linked Data Challenge (QALD-7) and the Large-Scale Complex Question Answering Dataset (LC-QuAD). Experimental results show that our QA system outperforms the state-of-art systems by 15% on the QALD-7 dataset and by 48% on the LC-QuAD dataset, respectively. In addition, we make our source code available."

It outlines what the literature tells us about the nature of the decisions that leaders at the country level are taking during humanitarian operations, and the circumstances under which these decisions are taken. It then considers the potential application of two different types of decision-making process in these contexts: rational/analytical decision-making and naturalistic decision-making.

Peptic activity was significantly decreased as compared with that of normal controls. In the rats pre-treated with chitin and chitosan 2% along with feed, the volume and acid output and peptic activity of gastric mucosa were maintained at near normal levels. The level of lipid peroxidation was significantly higher in the ulcerated mucosa when compared with that of normal controls. This was paralleled by a decline in the level of reduced glutathione and in the activity of antioxidant enzymes like GPx, GST, CAT and SOD in the gastric mucosa of ulcer-induced rats.

               The invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has quickly colonized shallow-water habitats in the North American Great Lakes since the 1980s but the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is becoming dominant in both shallow and deep-water habitats. While quagga mussel shell morphology differs between shallow and deep habitats, functional causes and consequences of such difference are unknown. We examined whether quagga mussel shell morphology could be induced by three environmental variables through developmental plasticity. We predicted that shallow-water conditions (high temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype typical of wild quagga mussels from shallow habitats, while deep-water conditions (low temperature, food quantity, water motion) would yield a morphotype present in deep habitats. We tested this prediction by examining shell morphology and growth rate of quagga mussels collected from shallow and deep habitats and reared under common-garden treatments that manipulated the three variables. Shell morphology was quantified using the polar moment of inertia. Of the variables tested, temperature had the greatest effect on shell morphology. Higher temperature (∼18–20°C) yielded a morphotype typical of wild shallow mussels regardless of the levels of food quantity or water motion. In contrast, lower temperature (∼6–8°C) yielded a morphotype approaching that of wild deep mussels. If shell morphology has functional consequences in particular habitats, a plastic response might confer quagga mussels with a greater ability than zebra mussels to colonize a wider range of habitats within the Great Lakes."

This question is of interest because it is well known that compressive residual stresses are often induced by special surface treatments (such as shot peening) to improve the fatigue life of metal parts; however, if cyclic relaxation occurs, the beneficial effects can, in part, vanish during service. Two hardened and tempered steels of grade C45 and 39NiCrMo3 were used in the tests. For both materials, different specimens were given two surface treatments: simple turning without successive surface treatment, inducing on the surface a moderate tensile residual stress state, and shot peening, inducing high residual compressive stresses. The specimens were submitted to constant-amplitude tension-compression fatigue loading, and the surface residual stresses were measured after 0, 1, 10 cycles and more. Results show that relaxation occurs from the very first cycle; the amount of residual stress relaxation depends on many parameters and on the type of steel. The results are in agreement with data obtained by other researchers. "

The resulting analysis models the joint as an adherend-adhesive sandwich capable of sustaining any combination of end load conditions, thus enabling a wide variety of adhesive joints to be modelled. The adhesive is assumed to behave as a coupled set of non-linear shear and tension springs, and the adherends as cylindrically bent plates which yield under the action of combined tension and bending. The complete problem is reduced to a set of six non-linear first-order ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically using a finite-difference method. In this way a reasonable assessment of adhesive stresses and strains can be obtained easily, without resorting to the complexity of a two-dimensional finite element solution. A comparison between the results from these two methods has been made and is presented in this paper after the outline of the analysis derivations."

A number of recent data sets and a body of new research allow us to start building an image of the way the extremely poor live their lives. Our discussion builds on household surveys conducted in 13 countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, South Africa, Tanzania, and Timor Leste (East Timor). These surveys provide detailed information on extremely poor households around the world, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, including information on what they consume, where they work, and how they save and borrow. We consider the extremely poor—those living in households where the consumption per capita is less than $1.08 per person per day—as well as the merely “poor”—defined as those who live under $2.16 a day—using 1993 purchasing power parity as benchmark. In keeping with convention, we call these the $1 and $2 dollar poverty lines, respectively. "

Transportation costs are lower for large ships than for small ships, but their use increases planning complexity and creates problems in production. In 2001, the company faced overwhelming operational challenges and sought operations-research-based planning support. The CEO, Sturla Steinsvik, contacted Møre Research Molde, which conducted a project that led to the development of a decision-support system (DSS) for maritime inventory routing. The core of the DSS is an optimization model that is solved through a metaheuristic-based algorithm. The system helps planners to make stronger, faster decisions and has increased predictability and flexibility throughout the supply chain. It has saved production and transportation costs close to US$7 million a year. We project additional direct savings of nearly US$4 million a year as the company adds even larger ships to the fleet as a result of the project. In addition, the company has avoided investments of US$35 million by increasing capacity utilization. Finally, the project has had a positive environmental effect by reducing overall oil consumption by more than 10 percent. "

All stock enters the system through the depot from where it is distributed to the retailers by a fleet of capacitated vehicles combining deliveries into efficient routes. Inventories are kept at the retailers but not at the depot.  We wish to determine feasible replenishment strategies (i.e., inventory rules and routing patterns) minimising (infinite horizon) long-run average transportation and inventory costs. We restrict ourselves to a class of strategies in which a collection of regions (sets of retailers) is specified which cover all outlets: if an outlet belongs to several regions, a specific fraction of its sales/operations is assigned to each of these regions. Each time one of the retailers in a given region receives a delivery, this delivery is made by a vehicle who visits all other outlets in the region as well (in an efficient route).  We describe a class of low complexity heuristics and show under mild probabilistic assumptions that the generated solutions are asymptotically optimal (within the above class of strategies). We also show that lower and upper bounds on the system-wide costs may be computed and that these bounds are asymptotically tight under the same assumptions. A numerical study exhibits the performance of these heuristics and bounds for problems of moderate size. "

All stock enters the system through the depot and is distributed to the retailers by vehicles of limited constant capacity. We assume that each one of the retailers faces a constant, retailer specific, demand rate and that inventory is charged only at the retailers but not at the depot. We provide a lower bound on the long run average cost over all inventory-routing strategies. We use this lower bound to show that the effectiveness of direct shipping over all inventory-routing strategies is at least 94% whenever the Economic Lot Size of each of the retailers is at least 71% of vehicle capacity. The effectiveness deteriorates as the Economic Lot Sizes become smaller. These results are important because they provide useful guidelines as to when to embark into the much more difficult task of finding cost-effective routes. Additional advantages of direct shipping are lower in-transit inventory and ease of coordination. "

The objective is to determine replenishment policies that specify the delivery quantities and the vehicle routes used for the delivery, so as to minimize the long-run average inventory and transportation costs.

Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives. We use a weighting method to find all supported points on the trade-off curve.

Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers’ inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management’s ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.

We apply it to the problem of replenishing inventory to subsets of products/locations, such as in the distribution of industrial gases, so as to minimize long-run time average replenishment costs. Given a marginal value for each product/location, whenever there is a stockout the dispatcher compares the total value of each feasible replenishment with its cost, and chooses one that maximizes the surplus. We derive this operating policy using a linear functional approximation to the optimal value function of a semi-Markov decision process on continuous spaces. This approximation also leads to a math program whose optimal dual prices yield values and whose optimal objective value gives a lower bound on system performance. We use duality theory to show that optimal prices satisfy several structural properties and can be interpreted as estimates of lowest achievable marginal costs. On real-world instances, the price-directed policy achieves superior, near optimal performance as compared with other approaches. "

We obtain two such linear programs by formulating the control problem as a Markov decision process and then replacing the optimal value function with the sum of single-customer inventory value functions. The resulting approximation yields statewise lower bounds on optimal infinite-horizon discounted costs. We present a linear program that takes into account inventory dynamics and economics in allocating transportation costs for stochastic inventory routing. On test instances we find that these allocations do not introduce any error in the value function approximations relative to the best approximations that can be achieved without them. Also, unlike other approaches, we do not restrict the set of allowable vehicle itineraries in any way. Instead, we develop an efficient algorithm to both generate and eliminate itineraries during solution of the linear programs and control policy. In simulation experiments, the price-directed policy outperforms other policies from the literature. "

We utilize concepts from mathematical programming and game theory and design a mechanism to guide the carriers in an alliance to pursue an optimal collaborative strategy. The mechanism provides side payments to the carriers, as an added incentive, to motivate them to act in the best interest of the alliance while maximizing their own profits. Our computational results suggest that the mechanism can be used to help carriers form sustainable alliances. "

Vehicles may or may not be supposed to carry out completely all materials available, and products assigned to different frequencies may or may not share the same truck. Integer and mixed integer linear programming models are formulated for each of the resulting four situations, and their properties are investigated. In particular, we show that allowing products to be split among several shipping frequencies makes trucks traveling at high frequencies to be filled up completely. In this situation, trucks may always be loaded with products shipped at the same frequency. "

At a container terminal these containers are transshipped from one mode of transportation to another. Cranes remove containers from a ship and put them at a certain time (i.e., release time) into a buffer area with limited capacity. A vehicle lifts a container from the buffer area before the buffer area is full (i.e., in due time) and transports the container from the buffer area to the storage area. At the storage area the container is placed in another buffer area. The advantage of using these buffer areas is the resultant decoupling of the unloading and transportation processes. We study the case in which each container has a time window [release time, due time] in which the transportation should start.  The objective is to minimize the vehicle fleet size such that the transportation of each container starts within its time window. No literature has been found studying this relevant problem. We have developed an integer linear programming model to solve the problem of determining vehicle requirements under time-window constraints. We use simulation to validate the estimates of the vehicle fleet size by the analytical model. We test the ability of the model under various conditions. From these numerical experiments we conclude that the results of the analytical model are close to the results of the simulation model. Furthermore, we conclude that the analytical model performs well in the context of a container terminal. "

We present an integrated model, a mixed-integer linear program, to solve the ship-scheduling and the cargo-routing problems, simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates relevant constraints, such as the weekly frequency constraint on the operated routes, and emerging trends, such as the transshipment of cargo between two or more service routes. To solve the mixed-integer program, we propose algorithms that exploit the separability of the problem.

As a result, the relocation of empty containers has become one of the major problems faced by liner operators. In this paper, we consider the dynamic empty container allocation problem where we need to reposition empty containers and to determine the number of leased containers needed to meet customers' demand over time. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic network: in stage one, the parameters such as supplies, demands, and ship capacities for empty containers are deterministic; whereas in stage two, these parameters are random variables. We need to make decisions in stage one such that the total of the stage one cost and the expected stage two cost is minimized. By taking advantage of the network structure, we show how a stochastic quasi-gradient method and a stochastic hybrid approximation procedure can be applied to solve the problem. In addition, we propose some new variations of these methods that seem to work faster in practice.

Three heuristics have been developed to solve the vehicle routing problem with satellite facilities (randomized Clarke-Wright, GRASP, modified sweep). After the daily tours are derived, a parametric analysis is conducted to investigate the tradeoff between distance and annual costs. This leads to the development of the efficient frontier from which the decision maker is free to choose the most attractive alternative.

In the second problem, the vehicle delivers an entire load to one retailer (direct shipping) and the controller decides which retailer to visit next. The third problem allows the additional dynamic choice between the TSP and direct shipping options. Motivated by existing heavy traffic limit theorems, we make a time scale decomposition assumption that allows us to approximate these queueing control problems by diffusion control problems, which are explicitly solved in the fixed route problems, and numerically solved in the dynamic routing case. Simulation experiments confirm that the heavy traffic approximations are quite accurate over a broad range of problem parameters. Our results lead to some new observations about the behavior of this complex system. "

In the first study, six diabetic and five non-diabetic human volunteers had two uniform cuts created, one on each forearm. One forearm wound was treated with topical regular insulin (Iletin-II) and the other with normal saline four times a day until healed. Treatment was double-blind and forearms were assigned randomly. The wounds treated with insulin healed 2.4 ± 0.8 days faster than the wounds treated with saline (P &lt; 0.001 by paired t-test). Zinc is used to crystallise insulin. When wounds are treated with insulin, they are therefore also being treated with zinc. If insulin accelerates wound healing, it is not clear if the increase in the rate of healing would be due to insulin (a known growth factor), the zinc it contains, or a combination of the two. The second study used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design to compare the efficacy of insulin with that of a solution containing the same amount of zinc in accelerating the healing of standardised wounds in rats and humans. Although these pilot investigations did not have the power to define the relative roles of insulin and zinc with accuracy, the results suggest that zinc does play a role in the wound healing process. It is concluded that topical insulin accelerates wound healing in humans. More importantly, however, this study describes a method of creating uniform wounds in humans acceptable to an institutional review board, thus solving one of the major impediments to the scientific evaluation of human wound healing.

Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merri.), is an important crop in China, with an annual demand of approximately 110 million tons. However, in China, soybean production is threatened by more than 30 kinds of disease and 100 kinds of pests. With the rapidly increasing specialized information in the literature, it is difficult for farmers to keep up. Relation extraction automatically identifies and extracts structured knowledge from natural language text and thus can help to alleviate the problem. In this study, we propose to employ relation extraction to systematically extract information from expert-written text, and generate a knowledge graph from the extracted information. This case study was planned in China, therefore we mainly used Chinese texts. Firstly, we carefully chose expert-written text on soybean pests and disease, labeled the entities, and classified their thematic relations into five categories. Then, we built and trained three relation extraction models using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and evaluated their performance on our task. Finally, we constructed an example knowledge graph from the extracted information and demonstrated their potential usage for automatic reasoning and solution recommendation for pests and disease prevention. In total, this study sampled 1038 entities and 1569 relation instances. Experimental results showed that our best model achieved an F1 score of 98.49% on identifying relations from text. Experimental results also showed the effectiveness of the example knowledge graph.

One pair functions as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), the other with larger core offset as a low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI). In traditional Vernier-effect based sensors, an interferometer insensitive to environment change is used as sensing reference. Here in the proposed sensor, interference fringes of the MZI and the FPI shift to opposite directions as ambient RI varies, and to the same direction as surrounding temperature changes. Thus, the envelope of superimposed fringe manifests enhanced Vernier effect for RI sensing while reduced Vernier effect for temperature change. As a result, an ultra-high RI sensitivity of -87261.06 nm/RIU is obtained near the RI of 1.33 with good linearity, while the temperature sensitivity is as low as 204.7 pm/ °C. The proposed structure is robust and of low cost. Furthermore, the proposed scheme of enhanced Vernier effect provides a new perspective and idea in other sensing field."

<jats:title>Background</jats:title>
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are generally the chosen test for Chagas disease (CD) diagnosis; however, its performance depends on the antigen preparation adsorbed to the solid phase, which may lead to false-positive results and cross-reactions. The use of chimeric recombinant antigens can overcome this limitation. Four chimeric antigens from <jats:italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</jats:italic> (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4) were developed and evaluated in phase I, II and III studies using indirect ELISA as diagnostic platform. However, peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-human IgG antibody, which is employed in indirect ELISAs, limits its use for the detection of species-specific and class-specific antibodies. To overcome this limitation, peroxidase-labeled antigens can be utilized, diagnosing both acute or chronic infection, in a species and immunoglobulin class-independent manner, through the use of a double-antigen sandwich ELISA (DAgS-ELISA). We aimed to evaluate and validate the diagnostic performance of the chimeric antigens IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4 in the DAgS-ELISA platform.

DAgS-ELISA was optimized by checkerboard titration. In phase I study, 207 positive and 205 negative samples were evaluated. Cross-reactivity to other infections was also assessed using 68 samples. The selected conditions for the tests utilized 25 ng of antigen per well and the conjugate diluted at 1:2,000 for all molecules. In the phase I study, the areas under the curve of IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4 were 98.7%, 99.5%, 98.6% and 98.8%, respectively. Among the positive samples, IBMP-8.1 antigen classified 53 (25.6%) as false negative, IBMP-8.2, 27 (13%), IBMP-8.3, 24 (11.6%) and IBMP-8.4, 43 (20.8%), giving sensitivities of 74.4%, 87%, 88.4% and 79.2%, respectively. The only antigen that did not reach 100% specificity was IBMP-8.3, with 96.6%. IBMP-8.3 was also the only molecule to show cross-reactivity with HTLV.

Findings hinge upon an online survey conducted in May 2020 (N = 9,394). The empirical results quantify tremendous disruptions for both commuting and non-commuting travels, highlighting substantial reductions in the frequency of all types of trips and use of all modes. In terms of potential virus spread, airplanes and buses are perceived to be the riskiest transport modes, while avoidance of public transport is consistently found across the countries. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, the study sheds new light on the fact that two indicators, namely income inequality, expressed as Gini index, and the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants, aggravate respondents’ perceptions. This research indicates that socio-economic inequality and morbidity are not only related to actual health risks, as well documented in the relevant literature, but also to the perceived risks.

The MLP-OK model provided a more accurate estimation of SOC content with minimal estimation errors (ME: -0.028, 45 MAE: 0.042, RMSE: 0.066) for validation points compared to the other models. The MLP-OK model outperformed other models by 75.09 to 77.92%. The MLP-OK model estimated the lower and upper limits of the estimated and the measured values in a consistent manner compared to the other models. The spatial distribution map of SOC content obtained by ANN-kriging approach was significantly affected by ancillary variables, and revealed more detail than other interpolation methods in the northern, central, southwestern and southeastern parts of the study area. The results revealed that the assembling of MLP with OK model can contribute to obtain more reliable regional, national and global spatial soil information."

We developed a protocol for measuring cell count by disrupting the cell membrane and analyzing specific proteins within the cells and used it to analyze proteins from eosinophils and neutrophils.Methods: Lateral immunochromatographic (ICR) assays have been developed for eosinophil protein X (EPX) and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) as measures of the concentration of eosinophils and neutrophils. The correlation between the lateral ICR assays and cell counting of eosinophils and neutrophils was performed manually and with an automated cell counter. RIA assays measuring the same analytes were also compared with the results from cell counting and lateral ICR assays.Results: The optimized assays showed analytical detection limits below the clinical ranges of 3.36 μg/L and 2.05 μg/L for EPX and HNL, respectively. The recovery was 114.8%–122.8% for EPX and 94.5%–96.9% for HNL. The imprecision was 3%–17% CV for EPX over the whole range and 5%–16% CV for HNL. The correlation coefficients between manually counted cells and lateral ICR assays were 0.9 and 0.83 for EPX and HNL, respectively.Conclusion: The numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in small amounts of blood can be estimated in the point-of-care setting by means of fast lateral ICR assays of EPX and HNL."

            <jats:title>OBJECTIVE:</jats:title>
            Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus. In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>METHODS:</jats:title>
            In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020. All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>RESULTS:</jats:title>
            In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed. The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.

            <jats:title>DISCUSSION:</jats:title>
            We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels. Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms. However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.

For the successful implementation of TeDTs, conditions at both team and institutional levels have to be taken into account. However, there is little consensus among stakeholders about which of these conditions are of highest priority. Most studies present priority or critical conditions from the viewpoint of just one group (e.g., school leaders). A Delphi study was set up aiming at synthesising the knowledge and views of various stakeholders about the conditions for the successful implementation of TeDTs for ICT integration.

Maintaining privacy when publishing networked data is uniquely challenging because an individual's network context can be used to identify them even if other identifying information is removed. In this paper, we quantify the privacy risks associated with three classes of attacks on the privacy of individuals in networks, based on the knowledge used by the adversary. We show that the risks of these attacks vary greatly based on network structure and size. We propose a novel approach to anonymizing network data that models aggregate network structure and then allows samples to be drawn from that model.

In other words, the schemas of these tables -- attribute names, values, data types, etc. -- are not explicitly stored as table metadata. Consequently, the structure that these tables contain is not accessible to the crawlers that power search engines and thus not accessible to user search queries. We address this lack of structure with a new method for leveraging the principles of table construction in order to extract table schemas. Discovering the schema by which a table is constructed is achieved by harnessing the similarities and differences of nearby table rows through the use of a novel set of features and a feature processing scheme. The schemas of these data tables are determined using a classification technique based on conditional random fields in combination with a novel feature encoding method called logarithmic binning, which is specifically designed for the data table extraction task. Our method provides considerable improvement over the well-known WebTables schema extraction method. In contrast with previous work that focuses on extracting individual relations, our method excels at correctly interpreting full tables, thereby being capable of handling general tables such as those found in spreadsheets, instead of being restricted to HTML tables as is the case with the WebTables method. We also extract additional schema characteristics, such as row groupings, which are important for supporting information retrieval tasks on tabular data."

While rumours can have severe real-world implications, their detection is notoriously hard: Content on social platforms is short and lacks semantics; it spreads quickly through a dynamically evolving network; and without considering the context of content, it may be impossible to arrive at a truthful interpretation. Traditional approaches to rumour detection, however, exploit solely a single content modality, e.g., social media posts, which limits their detection accuracy. In this paper, we cope with the aforementioned challenges by means of a multi-modal approach to rumour detection that identifies anomalies in both, the entities (e.g., users, posts, and hashtags) of a social platform and their relations. Based on local anomalies, we show how to detect rumours at the network level, following a graph-based scan approach. In addition, we propose incremental methods, which enable us to detect rumours using streaming data of social platforms. We illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach with a real-world dataset of 4M tweets with more than 1000 rumours."

               Ontologies have become a key element since many decades in information systems such as in epidemiological surveillance domain. Building domain ontologies requires the access to domain knowledge owned by domain experts or contained in knowledge sources. However, domain experts are not always available for interviews. Therefore, there is a lot of value in using ontology learning which consists in automatic or semi-automatic extraction of ontological knowledge from structured or unstructured knowledge sources such as texts, databases, etc. Many techniques have been used but they all are limited in concepts, properties and terminology extraction leaving behind axioms and rules. Source code which naturally embed domain knowledge is rarely used. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for concepts, properties, axioms and rules learning from Java source code. This approach is experimented with the source code of EPICAM, an epidemiological platform developed in Java and used in Cameroon for tuberculosis surveillance. Domain experts involved in the evaluation estimated that knowledge extracted was relevant to the domain. In addition, we performed an automatic evaluation of the relevance of the terms extracted to the medical domain by aligning them with ontologies hosted on Bioportal platform through the Ontology Recommender tool. The results were interesting since the terms extracted were covered at 82.9% by many biomedical ontologies such as NCIT, SNOWMEDCT and ONTOPARON."

This article evaluates empirically the readiness of the EAC countries for monetary union. First, structural similarity in terms of similarity of production and exports of the EAC countries is measured. Second, the symmetry of shocks is examined with structural vector auto-regression analysis (SVAR). The lack of macroeconomic convergence gives evidence against a hurried transition to a monetary union. Given the divergent macroeconomic outcomes, structural reforms, including closing infrastructure gaps and harmonizing macroeconomic policies that would raise synchronization of business cycles, need to be in place before moving to monetary union.

Landsat satellite imageriesof three different time periods, i.e., 1991, 2000 and2014 were used to quantify the land use/cover changes inthe area. Supervised Classification using Maximum LikelihoodTechnique in ERDAS was utilized. The images werecategorized into five different classes: Open Savannah,Closed Savannah, Bare Areas, Settlement and Water. Imagedifferencing method of change detection was used toinvestigate the changes. Normalized Differential VegetativeIndex valueswere used to correlate the state of healthyvegetation. The image differencing showed a positive correlationto the changes in the Land use and Land coverclasses. NDVI values reduced from 0.48 to 0.11. The landuse change matrix also showed conversion of savannahareas into bare ground and settlement.

Introduction of deep neural networks to the machine translation research ameliorated conventional machine translation systems in multiple ways, specifically in terms of translation quality. The ability of deep neural networks to learn a sensible representation of words is one of the major reasons for this improvement. Despite machine translation using deep neural architecture is showing state-of-the-art results in translating European languages, we cannot directly apply these algorithms in Indian languages mainly because of two reasons: unavailability of the good corpus and Indian languages are morphologically rich. In this paper, we propose a neural machine translation (NMT) system for four language pairs: English–Malayalam, English–Hindi, English–Tamil, and English–Punjabi. We also collected sentences from different sources and cleaned them to make four parallel corpora for each of the language pairs, and then used them to model the translation system. The encoder network in the NMT architecture was designed with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-RNN). Evaluation of the obtained models was performed both automatically and manually. For automatic evaluation, the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score was used, and for manual evaluation, three metrics such as adequacy, fluency, and overall ranking were used. Analysis of the results showed the presence of lengthy sentences in English–Malayalam, and the English–Hindi corpus affected the translation. Attention mechanism was employed with a view to addressing the problem of translating lengthy sentences (sentences contain more than 50 words), and the system was able to perceive long-term contexts in the sentences."

Today, with increasingly large collections of literary texts being made available in digital form, computational approaches to literary style are proliferating. New methods from disciplines such as corpus linguistics and computer science are being adopted and adapted in interrelated fields such as computational stylistics and corpus stylistics, and are facilitating new approaches to literary style.The relation between definitions of style in established linguistic or literary stylistics, and definitions of style in computational or corpus stylistics has not, however, been systematically assessed. This contribution aims to respond to the need to redefine style in the light of this new situation and to establish a clearer perception of both the overlap and the boundaries between ›mainstream‹ and ›computational‹ and/or ›empirical‹ literary stylistics. While stylistic studies of non-literary texts are currently flourishing, our contribution deliberately centers on those approaches relevant to ›literary stylistics‹. It concludes by proposing an operational definition of style that we hope can act as a common ground for diverse approaches to literary style, fostering transdisciplinary research.The focus of this contribution is on literary style in linguistics and literary studies (rather than in art history, musicology or fashion), on textual aspects of style (rather than production- or reception-oriented theories of style), and on a descriptive perspective (rather than a prescriptive or didactic one). Even within these limits, however, it appears necessary to build on a broad understanding of the various perspectives on style that have been adopted at different times and in different traditions. For this reason, the contribution first traces the development of the notion of style in three different traditions, those of German, Dutch and French language and literary studies. Despite the numerous links between each other, and between each of them to the British and American traditions, these three traditions each have their proper dynamics, especially with regard to the convergence and/or confrontation between mainstream and computational stylistics. For reasons of space and coherence, the contribution is limited to theoretical developments occurring since 1945.The contribution begins by briefly outlining the range of definitions of style that can be encountered across traditions today: style as revealing a higher-order aesthetic value, as the holistic ›gestalt‹ of single texts, as an expression of the individuality of an author, as an artifact presupposing choice among alternatives, as a deviation from a norm or reference, or as any formal property of a text. The contribution then traces the development of definitions of style in each of the three traditions mentioned, with the aim of giving a concise account of how, in each tradition, definitions of style have evolved over time, with special regard to the way such definitions relate to empirical, quantitative or otherwise computational approaches to style in literary texts. It will become apparent how, in each of the three traditions, foundational texts continue to influence current discussions on literary style, but also how stylistics has continuously reacted to broader developments in cultural and literary theory, and how empirical, quantitative or computational approaches have long ­existed, usually in parallel to or at the margins of mainstream stylistics. The review will also reflect the lines of discussion around style as a property of literary texts – or of any textual entity in general.The perspective on three stylistic traditions is accompanied by a more systematic perspective. The rationale is to work towards a common ground for literary scholars and linguists when talking about (literary) style, across traditions of stylistics, with respect for established definitions of style, but also in light of the digital paradigm. Here, we first show to what extent, at similar or different moments in time, the three traditions have developed comparable positions on style, and which definitions out of the range of possible definitions have been proposed or promoted by which authors in each of the three traditions.On the basis of this synthesis, we then conclude by proposing an operational definition of style that is an attempt to provide a common ground for both mainstream and computational literary stylistics. This definition is discussed in some detail in order to explain not only what is meant by each term in the definition, but also how it relates to computational analyses of style – and how this definition aims to avoid some of the pitfalls that can be perceived in earlier definitions of style. Our definition, we hope, will be put to use by a new generation of computational, quantitative, and empirical studies of style in literary texts."

Background: Different infrared sensor, image processing, and display technologies can be integrated into an NVES to support nighttime driving. Because each of these components has its specific strengths and weaknesses, careful testing is required to determine their best combination. Method: Six prototypical systems were assessed in two steps. First, a heuristic evaluation with experts from ergonomics, perception, and traffic psychology was conducted. It produced a broad overview of possible effects of system properties on driving. Based on these results, an experimental field study with 15 experienced drivers was performed. Criteria used to evaluate the development potential of the six prototypes were the usability dimensions of effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction (International Organization for Standardization, 1998). Results: Results showed that the intelligibility of information, the easiness with which obstacles could be located in the environment, and the position of the display presenting the output of the system were of crucial importance for the usability of the NVES and its acceptance. Conclusion: All relevant requirements are met best by NVESs that are positioned at an unobtrusive location and are equipped with functions for the automatic identification of objects and for event-based warnings. Application: These design recommendations and the presented approach to evaluate the systems can be directly incorporated into the development process of future NVESs. "

Whereas in the monkey, proprioceptive eye position signals have been recorded in the somatosensory cortex, in humans, no brain site has yet been associated with eye position. We aimed to disrupt the proprioceptive representation of the right eye in the left somatosensory cortex, presumably located near the representation of the right hand, using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Head-fixed subjects reported their perceived visual straight-ahead position using both left and right eye monocular vision, before and after 15 min of 1 Hz rTMS. rTMS over left somatosensory but not over left motor cortex shifted the perceived visual straight ahead to the left, whereas nonvisual detection of body midline was unchanged for either brain area. These results can be explained by the underestimation of the angle of gaze of the right eye when fixating the target. To link this effect more tightly to an altered ocular proprioception, we applied a passive deviation to the right eye before the visual straight-ahead task. Passive eye displacement modulated the shift in the perceived straight ahead induced by somatosensory rTMS, without affecting the perceived straight ahead at baseline or after motor cortex rTMS. We conclude that the anterior parietal cortex in humans encodes eye position and that this signal has a proprioceptive component."

Recent studies have shown that subjects without proprioception avoid this conflict and show a performance benefit. In this study, we tested whether deafferentation induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve mirror tracing skills in normal subjects. Hand trajectory error during novel mirror drawing was compared across two groups of subjects that received either 1 Hz rTMS over the somatosensory cortex contralateral to the hand or sham stimulation. Mirror tracing was more accurate after rTMS than after sham stimulation. Using a position-matching task, we confirmed that rTMS reduced proprioceptive acuity and that this reduction was largest when the coil was placed at an anterior parietal site. It is thus possible, with rTMS, to enhance motor performance in tasks involving a visuoproprioceptive conflict, presumably by reducing the excitability of somatosensory cortical areas that contribute to the sense of hand position."

Both the extent and probability of conformal behavioral adjustments decreased significantly relative to a sham and a control stimulation over another brain area. The posterior part of the medial frontal cortex has previously been implicated in behavioral and attitudinal adjustments.

These modulations must be under top-down control; however, the control mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here we investigated the causal contribution of the human frontal eye field (FEF) by combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with subsequent magnetoencephalography. Following inhibitory theta burst stimulation to the left FEF, right FEF, or vertex, participants performed a visual discrimination task requiring covert attention to either visual hemifield. Both left and right FEF TMS caused marked attenuation of alpha modulation in the occipitoparietal cortex. Notably, alpha modulation was consistently reduced in the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, leaving the ipsilateral hemisphere relatively unaffected. Additionally, right FEF TMS enhanced gamma modulation in left visual cortex. Behaviorally, TMS caused a relative slowing of response times to targets contralateral to stimulation during the early task period. Our results suggest that left and right FEF are causally involved in the attentional top-down control of anticipatory alpha power in the contralateral visual system, whereas a right-hemispheric dominance seems to exist for control of stimulus-induced gamma power. These findings contrast the assumption of primarily intrahemispheric connectivity between FEF and parietal cortex, emphasizing the relevance of interhemispheric interactions. The contralaterality of effects may result from a transient functional reorganization of the dorsal attention network after inhibition of either FEF."

Here, we used a conditioning-and-map approach in 11 healthy male humans (mean age 27 years) to further clarify the role of PMd in anticipatory motor control. We transiently disrupted neuronal processing in PMd, using either continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) at 80% (inhibitory cTBS) or 30% (sham cTBS) of active motor threshold. The conditioning effects of cTBS on preparatory brain activity were assessed with functional MRI, while participants lifted a light or heavy weight in response to a go-cue (S2). An additional pre-cue (S1) correctly predicted the weight in 75% of the trials. Participants were asked to use this prior information to prepare for the lift. In the sham condition, grip force showed a consistent undershoot, if the S1 incorrectly prompted the preparation of a light lift. Likewise, an S1 that falsely announced a heavy weight produced a consistent overshoot in grip force. In trials with incorrect S1, preparatory activity in left PMd during the S1–S2 delay period predicted grip force undershoot but not overshoot. Real cTBS selectively abolished this undershoot in grip force. Furthermore, preparatory S1–S2 activity in left PMd no longer predicted the individual undershoot after real cTBS. Our results provide converging evidence for a causal involvement of PMd in anticipatory downscaling but not upscaling of grip force, suggesting an inhibitory role of PMd in anticipatory grip force control during object lifting."

To this end, we exploited a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol over frontal cortex that is known to increase dopamine release in the striatum. This intervention was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the functional and topographic specificity of its consequences at the whole brain level. Participants were scanned both before and after off-line TMS while performing a cognitive switching task that is known to depend on a specific striatal substructure, the putamen.

Seventy-one nontreatment-seeking smokers viewed a sequence of 16 high or 16 low AS ads during an fMRI scan. Dependent variables were brain fMRI signal, the immediate recall of the ads, the immediate change in intentions to quit smoking, and the urine levels of a major nicotine metabolite cotinine at a 1 month follow-up. Whole-brain ANOVA revealed that AS and MSV interacted in the inferior frontal, inferior parietal, and fusiform gyri; the precuneus; and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC). Regression analysis showed that the activation in the dMPFC predicted the urine cotinine levels 1 month later. These results characterize the key brain regions engaged in the processing of persuasive communications and suggest that brain fMRI response to anti-smoking ads could predict subsequent smoking severity in nontreatment-seeking smokers.

Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis comprises one third of all antibiotic use in pediatric hospitals and 80% of all antibiotic use in surgery. Previous studies reported that antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis is often inconsistent with recommended guidelines. An electronic surveillance system was developed to measure antimicrobial utilization and to identify opportunities to improve and monitor the administration of antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis.
               Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with selected inpatient surgical procedures performed from May 1999 to April 2000 at 4 US children’s hospitals. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision surgical procedure codes were divided into clean or unclean categories, and an electronic surveillance system was designed using antibiotic and microbiologic culture utilization data to measure appropriate antimicrobial use associated with the surgical procedure. A medical chart review was conducted to validate the electronic system.
               Results. Ninety percent of cases were classified properly by the electronic surveillance system as confirmed by medical chart review. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis was not in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for almost half of all procedures. Prolonged antimicrobial administration in clean surgical procedures was the most frequent deviation from guidelines. Statistical differences between the index hospital and the comparison hospitals reflect both over- and underutilization of surgical prophylaxis with significant opportunity to improve prophylaxis for all hospitals.
               Conclusions. Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis at the children’s hospitals studied is not always consistent with published AAP guidelines. This electronic surveillance system provides a rapid, reproducible, and validated tool to measure easily the efforts to improve adherence to AAP surgical prophylaxis guidelines."

               CONCLUSIONS. The video-game intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for education and training in health care."

Effects of social distancing on COVID-19,http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R110445,Public Administration,"Abstract What is the effect of social distancing policies on the spread of the new coronavirus? Social distancing policies rose to prominence as most capable of containing contagion and saving lives. Our purpose in this paper is to identify the causal effect of social distancing policies on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and on contagion velocity. We align our main argument with the existing scientific consensus: social distancing policies negatively affect the number of cases. To test this hypothesis, we construct a dataset with daily information on 78 affected countries in the world. We compute several relevant measures from publicly available information on the number of cases and deaths to estimate causal effects for short-term and cumulative effects of social distancing policies. We use a time-series cross-sectional matching approach to match countries’ observable histories. Causal effects (ATTs and ATEs) can be extracted via a dif-in-dif estimator. Results show that social distancing policies reduce the aggregated number of cases by 4,832 on average (or 17.5/100 thousand), but only when strict measures are adopted. This effect seems to manifest from the third week onwards."

We take conceptual information as a kind of knowledge and incorporate it into deep neural networks. For the purpose of measuring the importance of knowledge, we introduce attention mechanisms and propose deep Short Text Classification with Knowledge powered Attention (STCKA). We utilize Concept towards Short Text (CST) attention and Concept towards Concept Set (C-CS) attention to acquire the weight of concepts from two aspects. And we classify a short text with the help of conceptual information.

We first construct a semantic similarity graph, which is referred as semantic knowledge, based on a large collection of semantic lists extracted from the web using several pre-defined HTML tag patterns.

However, most existing methods only exploit the visual cues of these concepts but ignore external knowledge information for modeling explicit relationships between them. In fact, humans have remarkable ability to transfer knowledge learned from familiar classes to recognize unfamiliar classes. To narrow the knowledge gap between existing methods and humans, we propose an end-to-end ZSAR framework based on a structured knowledge graph, which can jointly model the relationships between action-attribute, action-action, and attribute-attribute. To effectively leverage the knowledge graph, we design a novel Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Network (TS-GCN) consisting of a classifier branch and an instance branch. Specifically, the classifier branch takes the semantic-embedding vectors of all the concepts as input, then generates the classifiers for action categories. The instance branch maps the attribute embeddings and scores of each video instance into an attribute-feature space. Finally, the generated classifiers are evaluated on the attribute features of each video, and a classification loss is adopted for optimizing the whole network. In addition, a self-attention module is utilized to model the temporal information of videos. Extensive experimental results on three realistic action benchmarks Olympic Sports, HMDB51 and UCF101 demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework."

Meanwhile, detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation; and a GCN with an opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor dispersion. Moreover, the information from source post is involved in each layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches."

However, too much knowledge incorporation may divert the sentence from its correct meaning, which is called knowledge noise (KN) issue. To overcome KN, K-BERT introduces soft-position and visible matrix to limit the impact of knowledge. K-BERT can easily inject domain knowledge into the models by being equipped with a KG without pre-training by itself because it is capable of loading model parameters from the pre-trained BERT. Our investigation reveals promising results in twelve NLP tasks.

        Many Knowledge Bases (KBs) are now readily available and encompass colossal quantities of information thanks to either a long-term funding effort (e.g. WordNet, OpenCyc) or a collaborative process (e.g. Freebase, DBpedia). However, each of them is based on a different rigorous symbolic framework which makes it hard to use their data in other systems. It is unfortunate because such rich structured knowledge might lead to a huge leap forward in many other areas of AI like nat- ural language processing (word-sense disambiguation, natural language understanding, ...), vision (scene classification, image semantic annotation, ...) or collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present a learning process based on an innovative neural network architecture designed to embed any of these symbolic representations into a more flexible continuous vector space in which the original knowledge is kept and enhanced. These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily used in recent machine learning meth- ods for prediction and information retrieval. We illustrate our method on WordNet and Freebase and also present a way to adapt it to knowledge extraction from raw text.

        Fake news spreading in social media severely jeopardizes the veracity of online content. Fortunately, with the interactive and open features of microblogs, skeptical and opposing voices against fake news always arise along with it. The conflicting information, ignored by existing studies, is crucial for news verification. In this paper, we take advantage of this ""wisdom of crowds"" information to improve news verification by mining conflicting viewpoints in microblogs. First, we discover conflicting viewpoints in news tweets with a topic model method. Based on identified tweets' viewpoints, we then build a credibility propagation network of tweets linked with supporting or opposing relations. Finally, with iterative deduction, the credibility propagation on the network generates the final evaluation result for news. Experiments conducted on a real-world data set show that the news verification performance of our approach significantly outperforms those of the baseline approaches.

        Structured knowledge about concepts plays an increasingly important role in areas such as information retrieval. The available ontologies and knowledge graphs that encode such conceptual knowledge, however, are inevitably incomplete. This observation has led to a number of methods that aim to automatically complete existing knowledge bases. Unfortunately, most existing approaches rely on black box models, e.g. formulated as global optimization problems, which makes it difficult to support the underlying reasoning process with intuitive explanations. In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge base completion, which uses interpretable conceptual space representations and an explicit model for inductive inference that is closer to human forms of commonsense reasoning. Moreover, by separating the task of representation learning from inductive reasoning, our method is easier to apply in a wider variety of contexts. Finally, unlike optimization based approaches, our method can naturally be applied in settings where various logical constraints between the extensions of concepts need to be taken into account.

        Knowledge graph (KG) is known to be helpful for the task of question answering (QA), since it provides well-structured relational information between entities, and allows one to further infer indirect facts. However, it is challenging to build QA systems which can learn to reason over knowledge graphs based on question-answer pairs alone. First, when people ask questions, their expressions are noisy (for example, typos in texts, or variations in pronunciations), which is non-trivial for the QA system to match those mentioned entities to the knowledge graph. Second, many questions require multi-hop logic reasoning over the knowledge graph to retrieve the answers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and unified deep learning architecture, and an end-to-end variational learning algorithm which can handle noise in questions, and learn multi-hop reasoning simultaneously. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark dataset in the literature. We also derive a series of new benchmark datasets, including questions for multi-hop reasoning, questions paraphrased by neural translation model, and questions in human voice. Our method yields very promising results on all these challenging datasets.

Most existing methods of fake news detection are supervised, which require an extensive amount of time and labor to build a reliably annotated dataset. In search of an alternative, in this paper, we investigate if we could detect fake news in an unsupervised manner. We treat truths of news and users’ credibility as latent random variables, and exploit users’ engagements on social media to identify their opinions towards the authenticity of news. We leverage a Bayesian network model to capture the conditional dependencies among the truths of news, the users’ opinions, and the users’ credibility. To solve the inference problem, we propose an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling approach to infer the truths of news and the users’ credibility without any labelled data.

This model achieves state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition, Entity Mention Detection and Relation Extraction without hand-engineered features or external NLP tools like syntactic parsers.

Via social media platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and put users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which can leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news detector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news based on users' reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction performance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the news content. We tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news articles published via WeChat official accounts and associated user reports.

In particular, the models often struggle to learn certain spatial, temporal, or quantitative relationships, which are commonplace in text and are second-nature for human readers. Yet, in many cases, these relationships can be encoded with simple mathematical or logical expressions. How can we augment today's neural models with such encodings?In this paper, we propose a general methodology to enhance the inductive bias of NNLMs by incorporating simple functions into a neural architecture to form a hierarchical neural-symbolic language model (NSLM). These functions explicitly encode symbolic deterministic relationships to form probability distributions over words. We explore the effectiveness of this approach on numbers and geographic locations, and show that NSLMs significantly reduce perplexity in small-corpus language modeling, and that the performance improvement persists for rare tokens even on much larger corpora. The approach is simple and general, and we discuss how it can be applied to other word classes beyond numbers and geography."

Specifically, we formulate the learning of the two hyper-parameters as an architecture selection problem where various configurations of kernel sizes and numbers of iterations are first defined, and then a set of soft weighting parameters are trained to either properly assemble or select from the pre-defined configurations at each pixel. In our experiments, we find weighted assembling can lead to significant accuracy improvements, which we referred to as ""context-aware CSPN"", while weighted selection, ""resource-aware CSPN"" can reduce the computational resource significantly with similar or better accuracy. Besides, the resource needed for CSPN++ can be adjusted w.r.t. the computational budget automatically. Finally, to avoid the side effects of noise or inaccurate sparse depths, we embed a gated network inside CSPN++, which further improves the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSPN++ on the KITTI depth completion benchmark, where it significantly improves over CSPN and other SoTA methods 1."

One document commonly contains multiple entity pairs, and one entity pair occurs multiple times in the document associated with multiple possible relations. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques, adaptive thresholding and localized context pooling, to solve the multi-label and multi-entity problems. The adaptive thresholding replaces the global threshold for multi-label classification in the prior work with a learnable entities-dependent threshold. The localized context pooling directly transfers attention from pre-trained language models to locate relevant context that is useful to decide the relation. We experiment on three document-level RE benchmark datasets: DocRED, a recently released large-scale RE dataset, and two datasets CDRand GDA in the biomedical domain. Our ATLOP (Adaptive Thresholding and Localized cOntext Pooling) model achieves an F1 score of 63.4, and also significantly outperforms existing models on both CDR and GDA.

The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains.

The operations for knowledge retrieval and encoding bring significant computational burdens, restricting the usage of such models in real-world applications that require high inference speed. In this paper, we propose a novel KEPLM named DKPLM that
 decomposes knowledge injection process of the pre-trained language models in pre-training, fine-tuning and inference stages, which facilitates the applications of KEPLMs in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we first detect knowledge-aware long-tail entities as the target for knowledge injection, enhancing the KEPLMs' semantic understanding abilities and avoiding injecting redundant information.
 The embeddings of long-tail entities are replaced by ``pseudo token representations'' formed by relevant knowledge triples. We further design the relational knowledge decoding task for pre-training to force the models to truly understand the injected knowledge by relation triple reconstruction. Experiments show that our model outperforms other KEPLMs significantly over zero-shot knowledge probing tasks and multiple knowledge-aware language understanding tasks.

A KG is a curated set of facts consisting of entities linked by relations. Certain facts include also temporal information forming a Temporal KG (TKG). Although many natural questions involve explicit or implicit time constraints, question answering (QA) over TKGs has been a relatively unexplored area. Existing solutions are mainly designed for simple temporal questions that can be answered directly by a single TKG fact.
 This paper puts forth a comprehensive embedding-based framework for answering complex questions over TKGs. Our method termed temporal question reasoning (TempoQR) exploits TKG embeddings to ground the question to the specific entities and time scope it refers to. It does so by augmenting the question embeddings with context, entity and time-aware information by employing three specialized modules. The first computes a textual representation of a given question, the second combines it with the entity embeddings for entities involved in the question, and the third generates question-specific time embeddings. Finally, a transformer-based encoder learns to fuse the generated temporal information with the question representation, which is used for answer predictions. Extensive experiments show that TempoQR improves accuracy by 25--45 percentage points on complex temporal questions over state-of-the-art approaches and it generalizes better to unseen question types."

For every τ ∈ N&gt;1, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of LEW , and prove that its satisfiability problem is NP-complete. In addition, we show that the finite axiomatisability of LEW depends on τ : if τ = 2 or τ = 3, then there exists a finite sound and complete axiomatisation; if τ &gt; 3, then the logic is not finitely axiomatisable. LEW can be easily extended to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Extending LEW to 2D Euclidean space makes it suitable for reasoning about not perfectly aligned representations of the same spatial objects in different datasets, for example, in crowd-sourced digital maps."

Since most existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of ""one type of temporal relation per discourse'', it extracts useful information from a cluster of topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging."

The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of key functional groups within an intact Wyoming big sagebrush–bluebunch wheatgrass community type on minimizing medusahead invasion. Treatments consisted of removal of seven functional groups at each of two sites, one with shrubs and one without shrubs. Removal treatments included (1) everything, (2) shrubs, (3) perennial grasses, (4) taprooted forbs, (5) rhizomatous forbs, (6) annual forbs, and (7) mosses. A control where nothing was removed was also established. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block with 4 replications (blocks) at each site. Functional groups were removed beginning in the spring of 2004 and maintained monthly throughout each growing season through 2009. Medusahead was seeded at a rate of 2,000 seeds m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> (186 seeds ft<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) in fall 2005. Removing perennial grasses nearly doubled medusahead density and biomass compared with any other removal treatment. The second highest density and biomass of medusahead occurred from removing rhizomatous forbs (phlox). We found perennial grasses played a relatively more significant role than other species in minimizing invasion by medusahead. We suggest that the most effective basis for establishing medusahead-resistant plant communities is to establish 2 or 3 highly productive grasses that are complementary in niche and that overlap that of the invading species."

To test their importance in invasion success of Crofton weed, we examined the phenotypic response and genetic variation of the weed by conducting a field investigation, common garden experiments, and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker analysis on 16 populations in China. Molecular markers revealed low genetic variation among and within the sampled populations. There were significant differences in leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and seed number (SN) among field populations, and plasticity index (PI<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>) for LA, SLA, and SN were 0.62, 0.46 and 0.85, respectively. Regression analyses revealed a significant quadratic effect of latitude of population origin on LA, SLA, and SN based on field data but not on traits in the common garden experiments (greenhouse and open air). Plants from different populations showed similar reaction norms across the two common gardens for functional traits. LA, SLA, aboveground biomass, plant height at harvest, first flowering day, and life span were higher in the greenhouse than in the open-air garden, whereas SN was lower. Growth conditions (greenhouse vs. open air) and the interactions between growth condition and population origin significantly affect plant traits. The combined evidence suggests high phenotypic plasticity but low genetically based variation for functional traits of Crofton weed in the invaded range. Therefore, we suggest that phenotypic plasticity is the primary strategy for Crofton weed as an aggressive invader that can adapt to diverse environments in China."

The pathogenesis of AKI in this setting is poorly understood, and pathologic descriptions are limited. The authors examined kidney histopathology of 42 patients who died of COVID-19.

            The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38–97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS.

In this exploratory study, we provide insights from interviews and focus groups with three different underserved audiences in Germany. We found that on the one hand, material exclusion factors such as available infrastructure or financial means as well as specifically attributable factors such as language skills, are influencing the audience composition of science communication. On the other hand, emotional exclusion factors such as fear, habitual distance, and self- as well as outside-perception also play an important role.

We argue that the impact of applications depends primarily on their ontology, and secondarily on smart technology and programming features. Consequently, we start by creating an overall ontology for the smart city, defining the building blocks of this ontology with respect to the most cited definitions of smart cities, and structuring this ontology with the Protégé 5.0 editor, defining entities, class hierarchy, object properties, and data type properties. We then analyze how the ontologies of a sample of smart city applications fit into the overall Smart City Ontology, the consistency between digital spaces, knowledge processes, city domains targeted by the applications, and the types of innovation that determine their impact. In conclusion, we underline the relationships between innovation and ontology, and discuss how we can improve the effectiveness of smart city applications, combining expert and user-driven ontology design with the integration and or-chestration of applications over platforms and larger city entities such as neighborhoods, districts, clusters, and sectors of city activities."

&#x0D;
Objective – Evidence from systematic reviews a decade ago suggested that face-to-face and online methods to provide information literacy training in universities were equally effective in terms of skills learnt, but there was a lack of robust comparative research. The objectives of this review were (1) to update these findings with the inclusion of more recent primary research; (2) to further enhance the summary of existing evidence by including studies of blended formats (with components of both online and face-to-face teaching) compared to single format education; and (3) to explore student views on the various formats employed.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Methods – Authors searched seven databases along with a range of supplementary search methods to identify comparative research studies, dated January 1995 to October 2016, exploring skill outcomes for students enrolled in higher education programs. There were 33 studies included, of which 19 also contained comparative data on student views. Where feasible, meta-analyses were carried out to provide summary estimates of skills development and a thematic analysis was completed to identify student views across the different formats.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Results – A large majority of studies (27 of 33; 82%) found no statistically significant difference between formats in skills outcomes for students. Of 13 studies that could be included in a meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference (SMD) between skill test results for face-to-face versus online formats was -0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.28 to 0.26). Of ten studies comparing blended to single delivery format, seven (70%) found no statistically significant difference between formats, and the remaining studies had mixed outcomes. From the limited evidence available across all studies, there is a potential dichotomy between outcomes measured via skill test and assignment (course work) which is worthy of further investigation. The thematic analysis of student views found no preference in relation to format on a range of measures in 14 of 19 studies (74%). The remainder identified that students perceived advantages and disadvantages for each format but had no overall preference.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Conclusions – There is compelling evidence that information literacy training is effective and well received across a range of delivery formats. Further research looking at blended versus single format methods, and the time implications for each, as well as comparing assignment to skill test outcomes would be valuable. Future studies should adopt a methodologically robust design (such as the randomized controlled trial) with a large student population and validated outcome measures."

Total species richness, alien species richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. We found no support for the hypothesis that community diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1‐m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> point scale, where we would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover increased with increasing native species richness in all communities. This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives and aliens.Blue oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and consistently had more alien than native species at the 1‐m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> scale. All of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion.In chaparral, both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the shrublands return to their former closed‐canopy condition determine alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance in favor of alien invasion.In the higher‐elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a function of fire severity and time since fire. High‐intensity fires create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low‐severity burns, and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on high‐severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about one‐third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a challenge for fire restoration of these forests."

While <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> has historically been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of brackish and salt marshes, it has been expanding seaward into more physiologically stressful regions. Here we test a leading hypothesis that the spread of <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> is due to anthropogenic modification of coastal marshes. We did a field experiment along natural borders between stands of <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> and the other dominant grasses and rushes (i.e., matrix vegetation) in a brackish marsh in Rhode Island, USA. We applied a pulse disturbance in one year by removing or not removing neighboring matrix vegetation and adding three levels of nutrients (specifically nitrogen) in a factorial design, and then we monitored the aboveground performance of <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> and the matrix vegetation. Both disturbances increased the density, height, and biomass of shoots of <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content>, and the effects of fertilization were more pronounced where matrix vegetation was removed. Clearing competing matrix vegetation also increased the distance that shoots expanded and their reproductive output, both indicators of the potential for <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> to spread within and among local marshes. In contrast, the biomass of the matrix vegetation decreased with increasing severity of disturbance. Disturbance increased the total aboveground production of plants in the marsh as matrix vegetation was displaced by <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content>. A greenhouse experiment showed that, with increasing nutrient levels, <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> allocates proportionally more of its biomass to aboveground structures used for spread than to belowground structures used for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, disturbances that enrich nutrients or remove competitors promote the spread of <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> by reducing belowground competition for nutrients between <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content> and the matrix vegetation, thus allowing <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">P. australis</jats:named-content>, the largest plant in the marsh, to expand and displace the matrix vegetation. Reducing nutrient load and maintaining buffers of matrix vegetation along the terrestrial–marsh ecotone will, therefore, be important methods of control for this nuisance species."

Thus, in order to prioritize conservation objectives, it is critical to identify those ecosystems where decreasing richness will most greatly magnify invasion risks. Our goal was to determine if invasion risks greatly increase in response to common reductions in grassland species richness. We imposed treatments that mimic management‐induced reductions in grassland species richness (i.e., removal of shallow‐ and/or deep‐rooted forbs and/or grasses and/or cryptogam layers). Then we introduced and monitored the performance of a notorious invasive species (i.e., <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Centaurea maculosa</jats:named-content>). We found that, on a per‐gram‐of‐biomass basis, each resident plant group similarly suppressed invader growth. Hence, with respect to preventing <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. maculosa</jats:named-content> invasions, maintaining overall productivity is probably more important than maintaining the productivity of particular plant groups or species. But at the sites we studied, all plant groups may be needed to maintain overall productivity because removing forbs decreased overall productivity in two of three years. Alternatively, removing forbs increased productivity in another year, and this led us to posit that removing forbs may inflate the temporal productivity variance as opposed to greatly affecting time‐averaged productivity. In either case, overall productivity responses to single plant group removals were inconsistent and fairly modest, and only when all plant groups were removed did <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. maculosa</jats:named-content> growth increase substantially over a no‐removal treatment. As such, it seems that intense disturbances (e.g., prolonged drought, overgrazing) that deplete multiple plant groups may often be a prerequisite for <jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">C. maculosa</jats:named-content> invasion."

In particular, the spread of alien plant species along such gradients might be limited by their ability to establish clinal patterns of trait variation. We investigated trends in growth and reproductive traits in natural populations of eight invasive Asteraceae forbs along altitudinal gradients in their native and introduced ranges (Valais, Switzerland, and Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, USA). Plants showed similar responses to altitude in both ranges, being generally smaller and having fewer inflorescences but larger seeds at higher altitudes. However, these trends were modified by region‐specific effects that were independent of species status (native or introduced), suggesting that any differential performance of alien species in the introduced range cannot be interpreted without a fully reciprocal approach to test the basis of these differences. Furthermore, we found differences in patterns of resource allocation to capitula among species in the native and the introduced areas. These suggest that the mechanisms underlying trait variation, for example, increasing seed size with altitude, might differ between ranges. The rapid establishment of clinal patterns of trait variation in the new range indicates that the need to respond to altitudinal gradients, possibly by local adaptation, has not limited the ability of these species to invade mountain regions. Studies are now needed to test the underlying mechanisms of altitudinal clines in traits of alien species."

Natural experiments can be used to quantify the role of this factor relative to others in driving establishment success. An irrigation network in South Africa takes water from an inter‐basin water transfer (IBWT) scheme to supply multiple small irrigation ponds. We compared fish community composition upstream, within, and downstream of the irrigation network, to show that this system is a unidirectional dispersal network with a single immigration source. We then assessed the effect of propagule pressure and biological adaptation on the colonization success of nine fish species across 30 recipient ponds of varying age. Establishing species received significantly more propagules at the source than did incidental species, while rates of establishment across the ponds displayed a saturation response to propagule pressure. This shows that propagule pressure is a significant driver of establishment overall. Those species that did not establish were either extremely rare at the immigration source or lacked the reproductive adaptations to breed in the ponds. The ability of all nine species to arrive at some of the ponds illustrates how long‐term continuous propagule pressure from IBWT infrastructure enables range expansion of fishes. The quantitative link between propagule pressure and success and rate of population establishment confirms the driving role of this factor in fish invasion ecology."

The ERH is rarely tested experimentally, however, and is often assumed from observations of enemy loss. We provide a rigorous test of the link between enemy loss and enemy release by conducting observational surveys and an in situ parasitoid exclusion experiment in multiple locations in the native and introduced ranges of a gall‐forming insect, <jats:italic>Neuroterus saltatorius</jats:italic>, which was introduced poleward, within North America. Observational surveys revealed that the gall‐former experienced increased demographic success and lower parasitoid attack in the introduced range. Also, a different composition of parasitoids attacked the gall‐former in the introduced range. These observational results show that enemies were lost and provide support for the ERH. Experimental results, however, revealed that, while some enemy release occurred, it was not the sole driver of demographic success. This was because background mortality in the absence of enemies was higher in the native range than in the introduced range, suggesting that factors other than parasitoids limit the species in its native range and contribute to its success in its introduced range. Our study demonstrates the importance of measuring the effect of enemies in the context of other community interactions in both ranges to understand what factors cause the increased demographic success of introduced species. This case also highlights that species can experience very different dynamics when introduced into ecologically similar communities."

However, release operating early in invasion could be lost over time and with increased range size as introduced species acquire new enemies. We used three years of data, from 61 plant species planted into common gardens, to determine whether (1) invasive, noninvasive exotic, and native species experience differential damage from insect herbivores and mammalian browsers, and (2) enemy release is lost with increased residence time and geographic spread in the introduced range. We find no evidence suggesting enemy release is a general mechanism contributing to invasiveness in this region. Invasive species received the most insect herbivory, and damage increased with longer residence times and larger range sizes at three spatial scales. Our results show that invasive and exotic species fail to escape enemies, particularly over longer temporal and larger spatial scales."

The purpose of this article is to present an alternative paradigm of societal problem solving entirely premised on second generation innovation processes. Further, a theoretical model of multidimensional, or three dimensional, knowledge creation is offered, together with the notion of a multiplier effect that relates to how knowledge creation can increase exponentially when knowledge is not constrained by proprietary requirements. Second generation innovation is based on probabilistic processes that utilize and maximize economies of scale in pursuit of problem solving. Two processes that contribute to the potential of second generation innovation to solve societal problems are crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. It is argued that the processes required to enable a new paradigm in societal problem solving already exist. A further model is developed based on potential synergies between crowdfunding and crowdsourced research and development. This theoretical model predicts that R&amp;D productivity can be accelerated significantly, and if applied in fields such as proteomics or medical research in general can accelerated increases in research output and therefore benefits to society."

This debate is fueled by surface problems of definition and vested interests of professional educators, but is more deeply marked by epistemological assumptions relative to the role of humans and human interaction in education and learning. The seminal article by Daniel and Marquis (1979) challenged distance educators to get the mixture right between independent study and interactive learning strategies and activities. They quite rightly pointed out that these two primary forms of education have differing economic, pedagogical, and social characteristics, and that we are unlikely to find a “perfect” mix that meets all learner and institutional needs across all curricula and content. Nonetheless, hard decisions have to be made.&#x0D;
Even more than in 1979, the development of newer, cost effective technologies and the nearly ubiquitous (in developed countries) Net-based telecommunications system is transforming, at least, the cost and access implications of getting the mix right. Further, developments in social cognitive based learning theories are providing increased evidence of the importance of collaborative activity as a component of all forms of education – including those delivered at a distance. Finally, the context in which distance education is developed and delivered is changing in response to the capacity of the semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 1999) to support interaction, not only amongst humans, but also between and among autonomous agents and human beings.&#x0D;
Thus, the landscape and challenges of “getting the mix right” have not lessened in the past 25 years, and, in fact, have become even more complicated.

               To ensure safe and efficient operations, all offshore operations follow a plan devised to take into account current operation conditions and identify the optimum workflow with the minimum risk potential. Previously, planners had to manually consult eight data sources, each with a separate UI, and summarise the plan in a.pdf document. Equinor's Operation Planning Tool (OPT) has been developed to easily present the planners with the technical conditions of a platform, identify potentially dangerous combinations of concurrent activities, and propose learnings from eight years’ worth of incident recordings – all relevant to the current list of planned activities. The tool aims to answer questions such as ‘are other activities planned for the same time which would make this activity unsafe?’ or ‘have incidents previously occurred whilst performing similar tasks on this equipment type?’.
               This paper details the development of the OPT with a particular focus on the application of Natural Language Understanding for extracting equipment types and tasks involved in previous incidents and relating these to planned activities. Utilising natural language processing techniques, a system has been developed that mines the content of Equinor's incident database, and assigns context to incidents, by identifying the systems, activities and equipment involved and the conditions on the asset at the time of the incident. The same context is also discovered from the content of planned activities. These key concepts are organised into a knowledge graph synthesising Equinor's institutional safety and operational experience.
               The OPT has reduced time spent planning by providing a single interface detailing a plant's technical conditions, all planned work orders and relevant lessons learned from previous incidents. By reducing the reliance on personal experience, the tool has provided subjectively improved risk identification and handling, plus faster knowledge transfer to new employees as well as focussed cross-platform knowledge sharing. The success of the tool highlights the strength of combining data and leveraging the vast quantities of historic data available both in unstructured and structured forms to create a safe, offshore work environment."

A multiple linear regression model and a stepwise multiple linear regression model were used to estimate soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen stocks. A total of 119 topsoil samples and nine remotely sensed environmental variables were collected and used for model development and validation. The results indicated that these two linear regression models showed good performance. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), aspect, elevation, and solar radiation were the key environmental variables affecting soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks. In topsoil, remote sensing technology could be used to predict the soil properties in layers; however, as the soil depth increased, the performance of the linear regression models gradually decreased."

Biochar was incorporated at rates of 10 Mg ha<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> (BC‐10), 20 Mg ha<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> (BC‐20), and 20 Mg ha<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> + triple super phosphate (BC‐20+P) and the stability, strength, and friability of soil aggregates evaluated. Biochar increased soil organic C (SOC) by 28 to 66% and decreased electrical conductivity (EC) relative to the untreated soil. The fraction of water‐stable aggregates was significantly improved by 27 to 53% in biochar treatments compared with the control. Biochar decreased the tensile strength of the large aggregates (4–8 and 8–16 mm), but increased same in the smaller aggregates (1–2 mm) and consequently led to significant improvements in soil friability and workability in the BC‐20 and BC‐20+P treatments. In perspective, incorporation of biochar may offer the potential to arrest the rate of degradation in highly weathered tropical soils and salvage the decline in their physical quality by minimizing the effects of soil erosion.</jats:sec>"

               Water scarcity in mountain regions such as the Himalaya has been studied with a pre-existing notion of scarcity justified by decades of communities' suffering from physical water shortages combined by difficulties of access. The Eastern Himalayan Region (EHR) of India receives significantly high amounts of annual precipitation. Studies have nonetheless shown that this region faces a strange dissonance: an acute water scarcity in a supposedly ‘water-rich’ region. The main objective of this paper is to decipher various drivers of water scarcity by locating the contemporary history of water institutions within the development trajectory of the Darjeeling region, particularly Darjeeling Municipal Town in West Bengal, India. A key feature of the region's urban water governance that defines the water scarcity narrative is the multiplicity of water institutions and the intertwining of formal and informal institutions at various scales. These factors affect the availability of and basic access to domestic water by communities in various ways resulting in the creation of a preferred water bundle consisting of informal water markets over and above traditional sourcing from springs and the formal water supply from the town municipality."

            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            A knowledge-based recommender system was implemented using ontology and several natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The development process was divided into 3 stages. In stage 1, an ontology was constructed to describe patient characteristics contained in the data. In stage 2, an algorithm was designed and implemented to generate recommendations based on the ontology. Patient data and educational materials were mapped to the ontology and converted into vectors of the same length, and then recommendations were generated according to similarity between these vectors. In stage 3, the ontology and algorithm were incorporated into an mHealth system for practical use. Keyword extraction algorithms and pretrained word embeddings were used to preprocess educational materials. Three strategies were proposed to improve the performance of keyword extraction. System evaluation was based on a manually assembled test collection for 50 patients and 100 educational documents. Recommendation performance was assessed using the macro precision of top-ranked documents and the overall mean average precision (MAP).

A total of 80 SWRL rules were defined to implement the semantic logic of mapping patient original data to the ontology vector space. The recommender system was implemented as a separate Web service connected with patients' smartphones. According to the evaluation results, our system can achieve a macro precision up to 0.970 for the top 1 recommendation and an overall MAP score up to 0.628.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            Knowledge graph embedding is an effective semantic representation method for entities and relations in knowledge graphs. Several translation-based algorithms, including TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, and TranSparse, have been proposed to learn effective embedding vectors from typical knowledge graphs in which the relations between head and tail entities are deterministic. However, in medical knowledge graphs, the relations between head and tail entities are inherently probabilistic. This difference introduces a challenge in embedding medical knowledge graphs.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            An adverse drug event (ADE) is commonly defined as “an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug.” Providing information related to ADEs and alerting caregivers at the point of care can reduce the risk of prescription and diagnostic errors and improve health outcomes. ADEs captured in structured data in electronic health records (EHRs) as either coded problems or allergies are often incomplete, leading to underreporting. Therefore, it is important to develop capabilities to process unstructured EHR data in the form of clinical notes, which contain a richer documentation of a patient’s ADE. Several natural language processing (NLP) systems have been proposed to automatically extract information related to ADEs. However, the results from these systems showed that significant improvement is still required for the automatic extraction of ADEs from clinical notes.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>
            This study aims to improve the automatic extraction of ADEs and related information such as drugs, their attributes, and reason for administration from the clinical notes of patients.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            This research was conducted using discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database obtained through the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) annotated with drugs, drug attributes (ie, strength, form, frequency, route, dosage, duration), ADEs, reasons, and relations between drugs and other entities. We developed a deep learning–based system for extracting these drug-centric concepts and relations simultaneously using a joint method enhanced with contextualized embeddings, a position-attention mechanism, and knowledge representations. The joint method generated different sentence representations for each drug, which were then used to extract related concepts and relations simultaneously. Contextualized representations trained on the MIMIC-III database were used to capture context-sensitive meanings of words. The position-attention mechanism amplified the benefits of the joint method by generating sentence representations that capture long-distance relations. Knowledge representations were obtained from graph embeddings created using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database to improve relation extraction, especially when contextual clues were insufficient.

            Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud-based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea’s strategy of aggressive mitigation has “flattened the curve” of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible.

            Although electronic health record systems have facilitated clinical documentation in health care, they have also introduced new challenges, such as the proliferation of redundant information through the use of copy and paste commands or templates. One approach to trimming down bloated clinical documentation and improving clinical summarization is to identify highly similar text snippets with the goal of removing such text.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>
            We developed a natural language processing system for the task of assessing clinical semantic textual similarity. The system assigns scores to pairs of clinical text snippets based on their clinical semantic similarity.
          </jats:sec>
          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            We leveraged recent advances in natural language processing and graph representation learning to create a model that combines linguistic and domain knowledge information from the MedSTS data set to assess clinical semantic textual similarity. We used bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)–based models as text encoders for the sentence pairs in the data set and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) as graph encoders for corresponding concept graphs that were constructed based on the sentences. We also explored techniques, including data augmentation, ensembling, and knowledge distillation, to improve the model’s performance, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r).

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            Fine-tuning the BERT_base and ClinicalBERT models on the MedSTS data set provided a strong baseline (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.842 and 0.848, respectively) compared to those of the previous year’s submissions. Our data augmentation techniques yielded moderate gains in performance, and adding a GCN-based graph encoder to incorporate the concept graphs also boosted performance, especially when the node features were initialized with pretrained knowledge graph embeddings of the concepts (r=0.868). As expected, ensembling improved performance, and performing multisource ensembling by using different language model variants, conducting knowledge distillation with the multisource ensemble model, and taking a final ensemble of the distilled models further improved the system’s performance (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.875, 0.878, and 0.882, respectively).

            With the popularity of electronic health records (EHRs), the quality of health care has been improved. However, there are also some problems caused by EHRs, such as the growing use of copy-and-paste and templates, resulting in EHRs of low quality in content. In order to minimize data redundancy in different documents, Harvard Medical School and Mayo Clinic organized a national natural language processing (NLP) clinical challenge (n2c2) on clinical semantic textual similarity (ClinicalSTS) in 2019. The task of this challenge is to compute the semantic similarity among clinical text snippets.

            We propose a semantically enhanced text matching model for the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP (OHNLP) challenge on ClinicalSTS. The model includes 3 representation modules to encode clinical text snippet pairs at different levels: (1) character-level representation module based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to tackle the out-of-vocabulary problem in NLP; (2) sentence-level representation module that adopts a pretrained language model bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) to encode clinical text snippet pairs; and (3) entity-level representation module to model clinical entity information in clinical text snippets. In the case of entity-level representation, we compare 2 methods. One encodes entities by the entity-type label sequence corresponding to text snippet (called entity I), whereas the other encodes entities by their representation in MeSH, a knowledge graph in the medical domain (called entity II).

The model only using BERT for text snippet pair encoding achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.848. When character-level representation and entity-level representation are individually added into our model, the PCC increased to 0.857 and 0.854 (entity I)/0.859 (entity II), respectively. When both character-level representation and entity-level representation are added into our model, the PCC further increased to 0.861 (entity I) and 0.868 (entity II).

            Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications.

We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results.

            A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020.  The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, σx=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; σx=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; σx=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; σx=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors’ affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases.

            COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, is considered the most threatening respiratory infection in the world, with over 40 million people infected and over 0.934 million related deaths reported worldwide. It is speculated that epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 may differ across countries or continents. Genomic comparison of 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes has shown that the average number of mutations per sample was 7.23, and most SARS-CoV-2 strains belong to one of 3 clades characterized by geographic and genomic specificity: Europe, Asia, and North America.

We also performed secondary structure prediction analysis for both sequences (mutated and wild-type) and “disorder” and “transmembrane” analyses of the protein. We analyzed both protein structures with an ab initio approach to predict their ontologies and 3D structures.

            Evolutionary analysis revealed that codon 9628 is under episodic selective pressure for all SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from the 4 countries, suggesting it is a key site for virus evolution. Codon 9628 encodes the P0DTD3 (Y14_SARS2) uncharacterized protein 14. Further investigation showed that the codon mutation was responsible for helical modification in the secondary structure. The codon was positioned in the more ordered region of the gene (41-59) and near to the area acting as the transmembrane (54-67), suggesting its involvement in the attachment phase of the virus. The predicted protein structures of both wild-type and mutated P0DTD3 confirmed the importance of the codon to define the protein structure. Moreover, ontological analysis of the protein emphasized that the mutation enhances the binding probability.

            Our results suggest that RNA secondary structure may be affected and, consequently, the protein product changes T (threonine) to G (glycine) in position 50 of the protein. This position is located close to the predicted transmembrane region. Mutation analysis revealed that the change from G (glycine) to D (aspartic acid) may confer a new function to the protein—binding activity, which in turn may be responsible for attaching the virus to human eukaryotic cells.

            <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
            The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) is a secure web-based tool that enables health care practitioners to monitor health indicators of public health importance for the detection and tracking of disease outbreaks, consequences of severe weather, and other events of concern. The ESSENCE concept began in an internally funded project at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, advanced with funding from the State of Maryland, and broadened in 1999 as a collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. Versions of the system have been further developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in multiple military and civilian programs for the timely detection and tracking of health threats.

          <jats:sec>
            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
            The features of ESSENCE include spatial and temporal statistical alerting, custom querying, user-defined alert notifications, geographical mapping, remote data capture, and event communications. To expedite visualization, configurable and interactive modes of data stratification and filtering, graphical and tabular customization, user preference management, and sharing features allow users to query data and view geographic representations, time series and data details pages, and reports. These features allow ESSENCE users to gather and organize the resulting wealth of information into a coherent view of population health status and communicate findings among users.

            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
            The resulting broad utility, applicability, and adaptability of this system led to the adoption of ESSENCE by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, numerous state and local health departments, and the Department of Defense, both nationally and globally. The open-source version of Suite for Automated Global Electronic bioSurveillance is available for global, resource-limited settings. Resourceful users of the US National Syndromic Surveillance Program ESSENCE have applied it to the surveillance of infectious diseases, severe weather and natural disaster events, mass gatherings, chronic diseases and mental health, and injury and substance abuse.

It has been unclear why this bacterium produces so many different toxins, especially since many target the plasma membrane of host cells. However, it is now established that C. perfringens uses chromosomally encoded alpha toxin (a phospholipase C) and perfringolysin O (a pore-forming toxin) during histotoxic infections. In contrast, this bacterium causes intestinal disease by employing toxins encoded by mobile genetic elements, including C. perfringens enterotoxin, necrotic enteritis toxin B-like, epsilon toxin and beta toxin. Like perfringolysin O, the toxins with established roles in intestinal disease form membrane pores. However, the intestinal disease-associated toxins vary in their target specificity, when they are produced (sporulation vs vegetative growth), and in their sensitivity to intestinal proteases. Producing many toxins with diverse characteristics likely imparts virulence flexibility to C. perfringens so it can cause an array of diseases. "

The calcitonin (CT), amylin (AMY), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on CGRP, AM, AMY, and CT receptors [122, 67]) are generated by the genes CALCR (which codes for the CT receptor) and CALCRL (which codes for the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, CLR, previously known as CRLR). Their function and pharmacology are altered in the presence of RAMPs (receptor activity-modifying proteins),  which are single TM domain proteins of ca. 130 amino acids, identified as a family of three members; RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3. There are splice variants of the CT receptor; these in turn produce variants of the AMY receptor [122], some of which can be potently activated by CGRP. The endogenous agonists are the peptides calcitonin, α-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-I), β-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-II), amylin (occasionally called islet-amyloid polypeptide, diabetes-associated polypeptide), adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin. There are species differences in peptide sequences, particularly for the CTs. CTR-stimulating peptide (CRSP) is another member of the family with selectivity for the CT receptor but it is not expressed in humans [87]. olcegepant (also known as BIBN4096BS, pKi~10.5) and telcagepant (also known as MK0974, pKi~9) are the most selective antagonists available, showing selectivity for CGRP receptors, with a particular preference for those of primate origin. CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) by itself binds no known endogenous ligand, but in the presence of RAMPs it gives receptors for CGRP, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin."

Data publication has emerged as a game-changing breakthrough in scholarly communication. Data form the outputs of research but also are a gateway to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. And yet stakeholders across the scholarly ecosystem, including practitioners, institutions, and funders of scientific research are increasingly concerned about the lack of sharing and reuse of research data. Across disciplines and countries, researchers, funders, and publishers are pushing for a more effective research environment, minimizing the duplication of work and maximizing the interaction between researchers. Availability, discoverability, and reproducibility of research outputs are key factors to support data reuse and make possible this new environment of highly collaborative research. An interoperable e-infrastructure is imperative in order to develop new platforms and services for to data publication and reuse. DataCite has been working to establish and promote methods to locate, identify and share information about research data. Along with service development, DataCite supports and advocates for the standards behind persistent identifiers (in particular DOIs, Digital Object Identifiers) for data and other research outputs. Persistent identifiers allow different platforms to exchange information consistently and unambiguously and provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse. Because of this, data publication can become a reality from a technical standpoint, but the adoption of data publication and data citation as a practice by researchers is still in its early stages. Since 2009, DataCite has been developing a series of tools and services to foster the adoption of data publication and citation among the research community. Through the years, DataCite has worked in a close collaboration with interdisciplinary partners on these issues and we have gained insight into the development of data publication workflows. This paper describes the types of different actions and the lessons learned by DataCite. "

Density and cover of non‐native species were consistently greatest at the reserve edges, decreasing rapidly with increasing distance from reserve edge. Numbers of native species showed little effect of distance from reserve edge. Fire had no apparent effect on abundance of non‐natives in <jats:italic>Allocasuarina</jats:italic> shrubland but abundance of native plants increased. Density of both non‐native and native plants in <jats:italic>Acacia acuminata‐Eucalyptus loxophleba</jats:italic> woodland decreased after fire. Fewer non‐native species were found in the shrubland than in the woodland in both unburnt and burnt areas, this difference being smallest between burnt areas. Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher in burnt areas of both communities and ammonium also increased in the shrubland. Levels of soil phosphorus and nitrate were higher at the reserve edge in the unburnt shrubland, but not in the woodland. There was a strong correlation between soil phosphorus levels and abundance of non‐native species in the unburnt shrubland, but not after fire or in the woodland. Removal of non‐native plants in the burnt shrubland had a strong positive effect on total abundance of native plants, apparently due to increases in growth of smaller, suppressed native plants in response to decreased competition. Two native species showed increased seed production in plots where non‐native plants had been removed. There was a general indication that, in the short term, fire does not necessarily increase invasion of these communities by non‐native species and could, therefore be a useful management tool in remnant vegetation, providing other disturbances are minimised."

Firms and individuals are extensively impacted, and many problematic issues remain to be researched. ERP and related integrated technologies are a transformative force on the accounting profession. As the nature of business evolves, accounting expertise is being called on to make broader contributions such as reporting on nonfinancial measures, auditing information systems, implementing management controls within information systems, and providing management consulting services. This review of ERP research is drawn from an extensive examination of the breadth of ERP-related literature without constraints as to a narrow timeframe or limited journal list, although particular attention is directed to the leading journals in information systems and accounting information systems. Early research consisted of descriptive studies of firms implementing ERP systems. Then researchers started to address other research questions about the factors that lead to successful implementations: the need for change management and expanded forms of user education, whether the financial benefit outweighed the cost, and whether the issues are different depending on organizational type and cultural factors. This research encouraged the development of several major ERP research areas: (1) critical success factors, (2) the organizational impact, and (3) the economic impact of ERP systems. We use this taxonomy to establish (1) what we know, (2) what we need, and (3) where we are going in ERP research. The objective of this review is to synthesize the extant ERP research reported without regard to publication domain and make this readily available to accounting researchers. We organize key ERP research by topics of interest in accounting, and map ERP topics onto existing accounting information systems research areas. An emphasis is placed on topics important to accounting, including (but not limited to) the risk management and auditing of ERP systems, regulatory issues, the internal and external economic impacts of ERP systems, extensions needed in ERP systems for XBRL, for interorganizational support, and for the design of management control systems.See Supplemental Material."

Our objective was to determine the effects of prescribed rangeland fire on dalmatian toadflax [Linaria dalmatica (L.) Miller] density, cover, biomass, and seed production. These plant characteristics, as well as density, cover, and biomass of perennial grasses and forbs were measured within burned and adjacent not-burned areas on 3 Artemisia tridentata/Agropyron spicatum habitat types in Montana. Areas were burned in the spring and measured in the fall 1999. Comparisons of plant characteristics between the burned and not-burned sites were made using t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. After 1 growing season, fire did not affect density or cover of dalmatian toadflax. Burning increased dalmatian toadflax bio- mass per square meter at 2 sites, and per plant biomass at all 3 sites. Seed production of dalmatian toadflax was increased by fire at all 3 sites. Fire reduced forb cover at 1 site and increased grass biomass at 2 sites. The increases in dalmatian toadflax biomass and seed production suggest that fire used to restore healthy plant communities may increase dalmatian toadflax dominance. We recommend weed management procedures, such as herbicide control and seeding desirable species, be integrated with prescribed fire where dalmatian toadflax is present in the plant community."

<jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To determine whether therapeutic concentrations of levetiracetam can be achieved in cats and to establish reasonable IV and oral dosing intervals that would not be associated with adverse effects in cats.
<jats:bold>Animals</jats:bold>—10 healthy purpose-bred cats.
<jats:bold>Procedures</jats:bold>—In a randomized crossover study, levetiracetam (20 mg/kg) was administered orally and IV to each cat. Blood samples were collected 0, 10, 20, and 40 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after administration.

					<jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To establish a dosing regimen for potassium
bromide and evaluate use of bromide to treat
spontaneous seizures in cats.
				
					<jats:bold>Design</jats:bold>—Prospective and retrospective studies.
				
					<jats:bold>Animals</jats:bold>—7 healthy adult male cats and records of
17 cats with seizures.
				
					<jats:bold>Procedure</jats:bold>—Seven healthy cats were administered
potassium bromide (15 mg/kg [6.8 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h)
until steady-state concentrations were reached.
Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were
obtained weekly until bromide concentrations were
not detectable. Clinical data were obtained from
records of 17 treated cats.
				
					<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>—In the prospective study, maximum serum
bromide concentration was 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/mL at 8
weeks. Mean disappearance half-life was 1.6 ± 0.2
weeks. Steady state was achieved at a mean of 5.3 ±
1.1 weeks. No adverse effects were detected and
bromide was well tolerated. In the retrospective
study, administration of bromide (n = 4) or bromide
and phenobarbital (3) was associated with eradication
of seizures in 7 of 15 cats (serum bromide concentration
range, 1.0 to 1.6 mg/mL); however, bromide
administration was associated with adverse effects in
8 of 16 cats. Coughing developed in 6 of these cats,
leading to euthanasia in 1 cat and discontinuation of
bromide administration in 2 cats.
				
					<jats:bold>Conclusions and Clinical Relevance</jats:bold>—Therapeutic
concentrations of bromide are attained within 2
weeks in cats that receive 30 mg/kg/d (13.6 mg/lb/d)
orally. Although somewhat effective in seizure control,
the incidence of adverse effects may not warrant
routine use of bromide for control of seizures in cats.

<jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of oral levetiracetam administered as an adjunct to phenobarbital treatment in cats with poorly controlled suspected idiopathic epilepsy.
<jats:bold>Design</jats:bold>—Open-label, noncomparative clinical trial.
<jats:bold>Animals</jats:bold>—12 cats suspected to have idiopathic epilepsy that was poorly controlled with phenobarbital or that had unacceptable adverse effects when treated with phenobarbital.
<jats:bold>Procedures</jats:bold>—Cats were treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h). After a minimum of 1 week of treatment, serum levetiracetam concentrations were measured before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after drug administration, and maximum and minimum serum concentrations and elimination half-life were calculated. Seizure frequencies before and after initiation of levetiracetam treatment were compared, and adverse effects were recorded.
<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>—Median maximum serum levetiracetam concentration was 25.5 μg/mL, median minimum serum levetiracetam concentration was 8.3 μg/mL, and median elimination half-life was 2.9 hours. Median seizure frequency prior to treatment with levetiracetam (2.1 seizures/mo) was significantly higher than median seizure frequency after initiation of levetiracetam treatment (0.42 seizures/mo), and 7 of 10 cats were classified as having responded to levetiracetam treatment (ie, reduction in seizure frequency of ≥ 50%).

<jats:bold>Objective</jats:bold>—To evaluate associations among etiologic classifications of seizures and signalment, clinical signs, and outcome in cats with various seizure disorders.
<jats:bold>Study Design</jats:bold>—Retrospective case series.
<jats:bold>Animals</jats:bold>—91 cats evaluated for seizure disorders at a veterinary teaching hospital from 2000 through 2004.
<jats:bold>Procedures</jats:bold>—Data regarding characteristics of the cats and their seizures were obtained from medical records. Seizures were classified as reactive, symptomatic, or idiopathic. Survival times were displayed as Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between etiologic classifications were assessed by log-rank test.
<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>—Over the 5-year period, the incidence of seizures among all cats evaluated at the hospital was 2.1%. Etiology was classified as reactive in 20 (22%) cats, symptomatic in 45 (50%), idiopathic or presumptive idiopathic in 23 (25%), and cardiac syncope in 3 (3%). Focal seizures with or without secondary generalization were recorded for 47 (52%) cats, and primary generalized seizures with or without status epilepticus were recorded for 44 (48%). Etiology was not associated with seizure type. However, mean age of cats with idiopathic seizures (3.5 years) was significantly lower than that of cats with reactive seizures (8.2 years) or symptomatic seizures (8.1 years). The 1-year survival rate for cats with idiopathic seizures (0.82) was longer than that for cats with reactive (0.50) or symptomatic (0.16) seizures.

This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for mild depression. Comparison groups were a treatment-as-usual group and another group receiving stress-management training by telephone. From 1,742 family practice patients screened for depression, 54 with mild depression entered the study. Treatment was provided by experienced family practice nurses, trained and supervised in the treatments. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was administered before and after the intervention period, and the Beck Depression Inventory and Duke Health Profile were administered at the end of the intervention period. Of the 36 subjects assigned to the problem-solving and stress-management groups, half dropped out early in the study. Five from the treatment-as-usual group were lost to follow-up. In the remaining subjects, there was a significant decrease in depression scores. There were no significant differences in the amount of decrease between the groups on any scores. The small sample and high dropout rate limit the interpretation of the findings. However, since all subjects tended to improve, regardless of treatment received, mild levels of depression may generally remit even without focal intervention, and watchful waiting may be a reasonable alternative for management.

Further, the annotation scheme in this work is designed by only an intra-annotator consensus—a single annotator first annotated the data to propose the initial scheme, following which, the same annotator reannotated the data to normalize the annotations in an adjudication stage. However, the expected goal of this work is to achieve a standardized retrospective model of capturing NLP contributions from scholarly articles. This would entail a larger initiative of enlisting multiple annotators to accommodate different worldviews into a “single” set of structures and relationships as the final scheme. Given that the initial scheme is first proposed and the complexity of the annotation task in the realistic timeframe, our intra-annotation procedure is well-suited. Nevertheless, the model proposed in this work is presently limited since it does not incorporate multiple annotator worldviews. This is planned as future work to produce a robust model.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework of knowledge-aware object detection, which enables the integration of external knowledge such as knowledge graphs into any object detection algorithm. The framework employs the notion of semantic consistency to quantify and generalize knowledge, which improves object detection through a re-optimization process to achieve better consistency with background knowledge.

However, depending on a type of a medical provider, medical claims can use medical codes from different ontologies or from a combination of ontologies, which complicates learning of the representations.  To be able to properly utilize such multi-source medical claim data, we propose an approach that represents medical codes from different ontologies in the same vector space. We first modify the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measure of similarity between the codes. We then develop a new negative sampling method for word2vec model that implicitly factorizes the modified PMI matrix. The new approach was evaluated on the code cross-reference problem, which aims at identifying similar codes across different ontologies. In our experiments, we evaluated cross-referencing between ICD-9 and CPT medical code ontologies. Our results indicate that vector representations of codes learned by the proposed approach provide superior cross-referencing when compared to several existing approaches."

In this paper, we study how general-purpose ontologies—specifically, MIT's ConceptNet ontology—can improve the performance of state-of-the-art vision systems. As a testbed, we tackle the problem of sentence-based image retrieval. Our retrieval approach incorporates knowledge from ConceptNet on top of a large pool of object detectors derived from a deep learning technique. In our experiments, we show that ConceptNet can improve performance on a common benchmark dataset.

However, we find historical user responses to previous articles are available and can be treated as soft semantic labels, that enrich the binary label of an article, by providing insights into why the article must be labeled as fake. We propose a novel Two-Level Convolutional Neural Network with User Response Generator (TCNN-URG) where TCNN captures semantic information from article text by representing it at the sentence and word level, and URG learns a generative model of user response to article text from historical user responses which it can use to generate responses to new articles in order to assist fake news detection.

Our approach performs co-training of two embedding models, i.e. a multilingual KG embedding model and a multilingual literal description embedding model. The models are trained on a large Wikipedia-based trilingual dataset where most entity alignment is unknown to training. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed approach on the entity alignment task improves at each iteration of co-training, and eventually reaches a stage at which it significantly surpasses previous approaches.

Given a user post, the model retrieves relevant knowledge graphs from a knowledge base and then encodes the graphs with a static graph attention mechanism, which augments the semantic information of the post and thus supports better understanding of the post. Then, during word generation, the model attentively reads the retrieved knowledge graphs and the knowledge triples within each graph to facilitate better generation through a dynamic graph attention mechanism. This is the first attempt that uses large-scale commonsense knowledge in conversation generation. Furthermore, unlike existing models that use knowledge triples (entities) separately and independently, our model treats each knowledge graph as a whole, which encodes more structured, connected semantic information in the graphs. Experiments show that the proposed model can generate more appropriate and informative responses than state-of-the-art baselines. "

Despite the many efforts made for injecting knowledge into PLMs, this problem remains open. To address the challenge, we propose DictBERT, a novel approach that enhances PLMs with dictionary knowledge which is easier to acquire than knowledge graph (KG). During pre-training, we present two novel pre-training tasks to inject dictionary knowledge into PLMs via contrastive learning: dictionary entry prediction and entry description discrimination. In fine-tuning, we use the pre-trained DictBERT as a plugin knowledge base (KB) to retrieve implicit knowledge for identified entries in an input sequence, and infuse the retrieved knowledge into the input to enhance its representation via a novel extra-hop attention mechanism. We evaluate our approach on a variety of knowledge driven and language understanding tasks, including NER, relation extraction, CommonsenseQA, OpenBookQA and GLUE. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve typical PLMs: it gains a substantial improvement of 0.5%, 2.9%, 9.0%, 7.1% and 3.3% on BERT-large respectively, and is also effective on RoBERTa-large."

We propose to train networks on argument labellings explaining the data, so that any sampled data outcome is associated with an argument labelling. Argument labellings are integrated as constraints within restricted Boltzmann machines, so that the neural networks are used to learn probabilistic dependencies amongst argument labels. Given a dataset and an argumentation graph as prior knowledge, for every example/case K in the dataset, we use a so-called K-maxconsistent labelling of the graph, and an explanation of case K refers to a K-maxconsistent labelling of the given argumentation graph. The abilities of the proposed system to predict correct labellings were evaluated and compared with standard machine learning techniques. Experiments revealed that such argumentation Boltzmann machines can outperform other classification models, especially in noisy settings."

Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) are a challenge for patient safety in the hospitals. Infection control committees (ICC) should follow CDC definitions when monitoring HAI. The handmade method of epidemiological surveillance (ES) may affect the sensitivity and specificity of the monitoring system, while electronic surveillance can improve the performance, quality and traceability of recorded information.
Objective:

To assess the implementation of a strategy for electronic surveillance of HAI, Bacterial Resistance and Antimicrobial Consumption by the ICC of 23 high-complexity clinics and hospitals in Colombia, during the period 2012-2013.
Methods:

An observational study evaluating the introduction of electronic tools in the ICC was performed; we evaluated the structure and operation of the ICC, the degree of incorporation of the software HAI Solutions and the adherence to record the required information.
Results:

Thirty-eight percent of hospitals (8/23) had active surveillance strategies with standard criteria of the CDC, and 87% of institutions adhered to the module of identification of cases using the HAI Solutions software. In contrast, compliance with the diligence of the risk factors for device-associated HAIs was 33%.
Conclusions:

The introduction of ES could achieve greater adherence to a model of active surveillance, standardized and prospective, helping to improve the validity and quality of the recorded information."

In art and design higher education programs, the transition from face-to-face learning to virtual learning is difficult for students in general, and even more difficult for students with hearing loss.  Art and design educators have explored approaches to effectively compensate for these challenges and optimize the distance learning experiences for DHH students.  This paper aims to investigate these challenges and attempts to explore the international best practices in distance education for deaf learners.  Action research is used as a methodology to guide the professional development of art and design educators on ways to refine and hone their online teaching approaches.  Ten DHH students (5 Males and 5 females) participated in the action research for the needs of this study.  Their challenges, experiences, preferences, needs and artworks were analysed in an attempt to optimize their online learning outcomes and provide recommendations that will lead to the implementation of effective teaching strategies and the design of appropriate e-learning environments for hearing-impaired art and design students.  The preliminary findings of the study revealed that the main challenges  DHH students and their instructors faced were communication barriers and misinterpretation of tasks, which led to difficulties in fulfilling the course intended outcomes. The recommendations formulated on the basis of the findings are to adapt the intended learning outcomes and teaching approaches to optimize the learning experiences of the DHH students."

Three of 14 countries with CDI surveillance used public health notification of cases as the route of reporting, and in another three, reporting was limited to public health notification of cases of severe CDI. The CDI definitions published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) were widely used, but there were differing definitions to distinguish between community- and healthcare-associated cases. All CDI surveillance systems except one reported annual national CDI rates (calculated as number of cases per patient-days). Only four surveillance systems regularly integrated microbiological data (typing and susceptibility testing results). Surveillance methods varied considerably between countries, which emphasises the need for a harmonised European protocol to allow consistent monitoring of the CDI epidemiology at European level.

MiBa-based surveillance includes electronic transfer of laboratory results, in contrast to the statutory surveillance based on manually processed notifications. Antibody index (AI) testing is the recommend laboratory test to support the diagnosis of LNB in Denmark. In the period from 2010 to 2012, 217 clinical cases of LNB were notified to the statutory surveillance system, while 533 cases were reported AI positive by the MiBa system. Thirty-five unconfirmed cases (29 AI-negative and 6 not tested) were notified, but not captured by MiBa. Using MiBa, the number of reported cases was increased almost 2.5 times. Furthermore, the reporting was timelier (median lag time: 6 vs 58 days). Average annual incidence of AI-confirmed LNB in Denmark was 3.2/100,000 population and incidences stratified by municipality ranged from none to above 10/100,000. This is the first study reporting nationwide incidence of LNB using objective laboratory criteria. Laboratory-based surveillance with electronic data-transfer was more accurate, complete and timely compared to the surveillance based on manually processed notifications. We propose using AI test results for LNB surveillance instead of clinical reporting.

First, we used the three types of support depicted in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (structure, involvement and autonomy support) to examine supervision practices in the doctoral context. Conversely, we used this material to discuss the theory and suggest new developments to it. 
To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 former PhD students (8 completers and 13 non-completers). The data were analyzed using deductive content analysis. The first aim led us to illustrate how supervisors offer structure, involvement, and autonomy support to the doctoral students, and to support the relevance of this theoretical framework in this particular context. The second aim led us to provide three avenues for reflection on SDT. 
First, a set of practices belongs both to structure and involvement and are therefore at risk of being overlooked in research. Second, there is a thin line between structure and control (and between autonomy support and chaos) and intentions to offer the first may easily turn into providing the second in practice. Finally, we developed the hypothesis that a necessary condition for supervisors to be able to offer positive support to their doctoral students is to consider them as trustworthy.

The purpose of this study is to improve the research process, supervision, and design of virtual environments in order to support this supervision. The study identifies the supervisory relationships that affect doctoral research conducted at a distance from the student’s academic institution. It also describes how students and their supervisors perceived the characteristics of supervision and the skills and attitudes students perceived in and expected from their supervisors. For data collection, semistructured interviews were used. The results indicate important differences between supervisors’ perceptions concerning their own role and students’ needs regarding supervision, and they demonstrate the importance of attending to student needs and, on the part of supervisors, exercising responsibility in the development of research competencies in students, as is the case of independence of criteria and autonomy.

However, there is a gap in our understanding of how supervision activities are associated with lack of wellbeing, such as burnout, and also to completion of the studies among doctoral students.

Background:	The study explored doctoral students’ perceptions of different aspects of supervision including the primary sources, frequency, expressed satisfaction and their interrelation with experienced stress, exhaustion and cynicism. 

Methodology: Altogether 248 doctoral students from three Finnish universities representing social sciences, arts and humanities, and natural and life sciences responded to an adapted version of a Doctoral Experience Survey. A combination of several measures was used to investigate the students’ experiences of supervision and burnout.

Contribution:	The results showed that students benefit from having several and different kinds of supervision activities. Various sources contribute not only to experiences of the doctoral journey and burnout, but also to the completion of the studies.

Findings: Experienced lack of satisfaction with supervision and equality within the researcher community and a low frequency of supervision were related to experiences of burnout. Experiences of burnout were connected to students’ attrition intentions. Attrition intentions were related to source of supervision, the form of thesis, and inadequate supervision frequency. Frequency was related to both experience of burnout and likelihood of attrition.

Recommendations for Practitioners: A recommendation developed from this research is to assist doctoral students with sufficient support, especially equality within the scholarly community and frequency of supervision. Further, greater emphasis could be put on group supervision and other collective forms of supervision. It is important that doctoral students develop networks both nationally and internationally.

Recommendation for Researchers: 	A recommendation emanating from this research is to put greater emphasis on further investigation of the role of other predictors in burnout in order to enhance doctoral students’ well-being.

Impact on Society: A better understanding of factors that promote lower attrition rates and enhance well-being for doctoral students is likely to lead to more efficient use of finacial and intellectual resources in academia and society more broadly.

Future Research: Given the results of this study, qualitative interviews might be helpful in mapping out the dynamics that lead to attrition and to identify the mechanisms in the researcher community that support the doctoral students and enhance well-being in their doctoral journey.

Background: Research studies from several countries have shown that carrying out a PhD can be a difficult experience resulting in high attrition rates with significant financial and human costs.

Methodology: The two studies presented in this article focus on biology PhD students from University Lyon 1, a very large French university (~40,000 students). A first study aimed at measuring the mental health and well-being of PhD students using generalist and PhD-specific tools. In a second study, we carried out and assessed a positive psychology intervention (PPI) aimed at improving PhD students’ well-being.

Contribution: Our work is one of the first characterizations of French PhD students’ mental health and well-being. As with other recent studies conducted in Western coun-tries, we found a high level of mental distress among PhD students. Our work also underlines the importance of taking many dimensions of the PhD (not only supervisor behaviour) in order to understand PhD student well-being. Cultural specificities are highlighted and can help inform the design of interventions adapted to each situation. The PPI showed pre-to-post positive changes on PhD students’ well-being. Further research is needed on a larger sample size in order to detect more subtle effects. However, these results are promising in terms of interventions that help reduce PhD student distress.

Findings: Study 1 involved 136 participants and showed that a large fraction of the PhD students experiences abnormal levels of stress, depression, and anxiety. We found that career training and prospects, research experience, and the impact of carrying out a thesis on health and private life have more impact on PhD students’ mental health than the supervisors’ behaviour. French PhD students’ well-being is specifically affected by career uncertainty, perceived lack of progress in the PhD, and perceived lack of competence compared to UK PhD students well-being, which suggests cultural differences about the PhD experi-ence in France compared to other countries. In study 2, the scores of the test and control groups (N = 10 and N = 13, respectively) showed a clear effect of the intervention on reducing anxiety.

Impact on Society: The high levels of mental health issues and reduced well-being in French PhD students reported in this study underline the importance of developing interventions in this field. Improving the supervisor-student relationship is one possibility but is not the only one. Interventions aimed at learning how to cope with the research experience and with the uncertainty with career pathways, and a good balance between PhD work and personal life present other promising possibilities

10765,10765,10.28945/4256,research problem,"Knowing Me, Knowing You: Teachers' Perceptions of Communication with their Students on Facebook",http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R584280,Educational Research,"Aim/Purpose: The purpose of the current study is to explore positive and negative aspects of teacher-teacher communication via Facebook, as perceived by teachers in secondary education.

Background: Teacher-student relationship is key to teachers’ wellness and professional development and may contribute to positive classroom environment. In recent years, as social networking sites (e.g., Facebook) became popular, these connections have extended to such platforms. However, most studies of the use of social networking sites in the school context are pedagogically-driven, and research on the ways teacher-student relationship is facilitated by these platforms is meager.

Methodology: We utilized a qualitative approach, analyzing responses to open-ended questions about this topic by middle- and high-school teachers’ all across Israel (N=180). We used both top-down and bottom-up analyses.

Contribution: This study contributes to the growing literature about the overall impact of using social networking sites on the educational milieu. Specifically, it contributes by shedding light on teachers’ perspectives of that phenomenon. Insights from this study are important for educators and education policy makers.

Findings: Overall, teachers who were connected to their students de facto, as well as teachers who expressed a wish to be connected to their students, acknowledged the advantages of befriending their students on Facebook, in terms of both teacher- and student benefits. Teachers’ overall viewpoint on the negative aspects of Facebook-connections with students is multifaceted. As such, our findings highlight the complexity of using social networking sites by teachers.

Recommendations for Practitioners: We recommend that educators who wish to extend the relationship with their student to online platforms do so wisely, taking advantage of the benefits of using these platforms, and being aware of (and cautious about) potential draw-backs. We encourage educators to learn more about the potential uses of social networking sites and instant messaging services, and then to examine whether these uses may fit their educational agenda. We recommend that education policymakers make evidence-based decisions regarding the use of social networking sites by teachers and encourage school communities to discuss these issues together.

Recommendation for Researchers: As technology develops rapidly, we recommend that researchers examine the topics raised in the current research with regards to other platforms, in order to better understand the technological aspects that may affect students’ perceptions of the use of social networking sites and instant messaging services to communicate with their students. The issues studied here should also be studied in different cultural contexts. We recommend broadening the research and making results available to policymakers when making decisions regarding social media in educational contexts.

Impact on Society: Understanding teachers’ perspectives of their relationship with their students in today’s digital, networked world gives us a better understanding of the changing role of teachers; hence, it may assist in planning teacher training and professional development, with the ultimate goal of realizing a better educational system.

Future Research: Future studies should focus on other social networking sites and instant messaging services, as well as on other countries and cultures.

The present study explores prevalence rates of burnout and psychological distress in a sample of psychology master’s and doctoral students at a university in a large urban Canadian city, as well as factors relating to their well-being, social support and stress.

Background: There are economic and productivity setbacks stemming from high stress and mental health challenges. Burnout and psychological distress of graduate students are associated with hindered academic progress, mental and physical health challenges, and reduced productivity. Further, emotionally exhausted doctoral students are at heightened risk for non-completion of their degrees.

Methodology: Sixty-two psychology graduate students completed an online survey that assessed burnout, psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms), perceived social support, collegiate sense of community, financial strain, and rank-ordered nine domains of graduate school stressors.

Contribution: The present paper contributes to the body of knowledge that graduate students residing in an urban Canadian city experience high rates of burnout and psychological distress. High levels of social support outside the academe were not protective factors in mitigating burnout.

Findings: Participants reported high levels of perceived social support and sense of community. However, over half (60%) of respondents met criteria for burnout, and one in three students met criteria for problematic levels of stress, anxiety, and/or depression. In a rank ordering question, “thesis, dissertation or other research”, “classwork” and “finances” ranked in the top three most stressful aspects of graduate school for respondents.

Recommendations for Practitioners: Graduate students experience unique stressors related to their mental health and well-being that differ from undergraduate students and young working professionals. Mental health practitioners may be better equipped to support graduate students with knowledge of these specific factors impacting mental health and well-being.

Recommendation for Researchers: Based on these findings, four areas of recommendations for psychology graduate institutions and training programs are discussed. These recommendations highlight the need for change across systemic levels and call for integrative efforts to improve wellbeing for psychology graduate students.

Impact on Society: Enhancement of doctoral student well-being could contribute to long-term benefits in academia and in higher education.

Future Research: The study took place before the emergence of COVID-19, which has undoubtably impacted graduate students globally. Research on student experiences during this unprecedented time is needed, as are additional supports (e.g., virtual programming to reduce social isolation; contingency plans for data collection).

The study examined the research impact of gold open access (OA) journals in engineering and technology. A total of 37 gold route journals that request article processing charges (APC) and 66 other OA journals without APC in the field were found in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and used for the study. The publishers, APC charges and the year each journal was added to DOAJ were identified and included in this study  An informetric approach was used to extract research impact indicators (citations, paper productivity, cite/paper, cite/journal and h-index) of journals. Findings revealed that the publishers of the APC journals were dominated by commercial publishing companies producing over 60% of the journals. Article processing charges ranged from 7.6 USD to 3471.5 USD while the average article processing charges for APC journals was 727 USD. Gold route open access (APC) journals performed better than open access non-APC OA journals since they produced 51.2% of the papers, 71.8% of the total citations and 65.1% of the total h-index. However, findings showed a weak positive correlation between articles processing charges (APC) of the gold route journals and their research impact; while there is high significant positive correlation between research impact of gold route (APC journals) and non-APC open access journals."

Researchers in the Global South often cite APCs as a major financial obstacle to OA publishing, especially in widely-recognized or prestigious outlets. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that authors from the Global South will be underrepresented in journals charging APCs. We tested this hypothesis using &amp;gt;37,000 articles from Elsevier’s ‘Mirror journal’ system, in which a hybrid ‘Parent’ journal and its Gold-OA ‘Mirror’ share editorial boards and standards for acceptance. Most articles were non-OA; 45% of articles had lead authors based in either the United States of America (USA) or China. After correcting for the effect of this dominance and differences in sample size, we found that OA articles published in Parent and Mirror journals had lead authors with similar Geographic Diversity. However, Author Geographic Diversity of OA articles was significantly lower than that of non-OA articles. Most OA articles were written by authors in high-income countries, and there were no articles in Mirror journals by authors in low-income countries. Our results for Elsevier’s Mirror-Parent system are consistent with the hypothesis that APCs are a barrier to OA publication for scientists from the Global South.</p>"

Yet in real-time language production and comprehension, speakers often mistakenly compute agreement between the verb and a grammatically irrelevant non-subject noun phrase instead. This phenomenon, referred to as agreement attraction, is modulated by a wide range of factors; any complete computational model of grammatical planning and comprehension would be expected to derive this rich empirical picture. Recent developments in Natural Language Processing have shown that neural networks trained only on word-prediction over large corpora are capable of capturing subject-verb agreement dependencies to a significant extent, but with occasional errors. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential of such neural word prediction models as a foundation for a cognitive model of real-time grammatical processing. We simulate six experiments taken from the agreement attraction literature with LSTMs, one common type of neural language model. The LSTMs captured the critical human behavior in three of them, indicating that (1) some agreement attraction phenomena can be captured by a generic sequence processing model, but (2) capturing the other phenomena may require models with more language-specific mechanisms</p>"

It is unclear, however, whether these OA mandates and policies increase the rate of OA publishing and data sharing within the research communities impacted by them. A team of librarians conducted a systematized review of the literature to answer this question. A comprehensive search of several scholarly databases and grey literature sources resulted in 4,689 unique citations. However, only five articles met the inclusion criteria and were deemed as having an acceptable risk of bias. This sample showed that although the majority of the mandates described in the literature were correlated with a subsequent increase in OA publishing or data sharing, the presence of various confounders and the differing methods of collecting and analyzing the data used by the studies’ authors made it impossible to establish a causative relationship."

Currently, decisions on what types of vehicles and how many vehicles to use are mostly made by service managers on an ad hoc basis without much systematic analysis and optimization. The objective of this research is to address the underlying fleet size and mix problem and to develop a practical procedure that can be used to determine the optimal fleet mix for a given application. A real-life example illustrates the relationship between the performance of a paratransit service system and the size of its service vehicles. A heuristic procedure identifies the optimal fleet mix that maximizes the operating efficiency of a service system. A set of recommendations is offered for future research; the most important is the need to incorporate a life-cycle cost framework into the paratransit service planning process. "

When the itineraries of its liner service routes are determined, the liner shipping company designs the schedules of the liner routes such that the wait time at transshipment ports is minimized. As a result of transshipment, multiple paths are available for delivering containers from the origin port to the destination port. Therefore, the medium-term (3 to 6 months) schedule design problem and the operational-level container-routing problem must be investigated simultaneously. The schedule design and container-routing problems were formulated by minimization of the sum of the total transshipment cost and penalty cost associated with longer transit time than the market-level transit time, minus the bonus for shorter transit time. The formulation is nonlinear, noncontinuous, and nonconvex. A genetic local search approach was developed to find good solutions to the problem. The proposed solution method was applied to optimize the Asia–Europe–Oceania liner shipping services of a global liner company. "

Exotics are generally characterised by a high propagule pressure and/or persistent seedbanks, thus future tarring of the Sani Pass may result in an increase of exotic species richness and abundance. This would initially result from construction‐related soil disturbance and subsequently from increased traffic, water run‐off, and altered fire frequency.

In this article, the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) ontology which supports such an assistant is presented. The ontology is developed on the basis that a proper axiomatization shapes the set of admitted models better, and therefore, establishes the ground for a better interoperability. On the contrary, underspecification facilitates the admission of non-isomorphic models to represent the same state which hampers interoperability. This ontology is developed on top of three ODPs (Ontology Design Patterns) which include proper axioms in order to improve precedent proposals to represent features of interest and their respective qualities, as well as observations and actuations, the sensors and actuators that generate them, and the procedures used. Moreover, the ontology introduces six domain ontology modules integrated with the ODPs in such a manner that a methodical customization is facilitated."

This paper presents a pipeline to discover health outcomes and related social factors based on trending SDoH at population-level using Google Trends. A knowledge graph was built from a corpus of research literature (PubMed) and the social determinants that trended high at the start of the pandemic were examined. This paper reports on related social and health concepts which may be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and may be important to monitor as the pandemic evolves. The proposed pipeline should have wider applicability in surfacing related social or clinical characteristics of interest, outbreak surveillance, or to mine relations between social and health concepts that can, in turn, help inform and support citizen-centred services."

In this paper we present the development effort made to build an ontology, called ExtruOnt, for describing a type of manufacturing machine, more precisely, a type that performs an extrusion process (extruder). Although the scope of the ontology is restricted to a concrete domain, it could be used as a model for the development of other ontologies for describing manufacturing machines in Industry 4.0 scenarios. The terms of the ExtruOnt ontology provide different types of information related with an extruder, which are reflected in distinct modules that constitute the ontology. Thus, it contains classes and properties for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial connections, features, and 3D representations of those components, and finally the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of machine. The ontology development process has been carried out in close collaboration with domain experts."

With numbers, it can be even harder due to the possible difference in measurement accuracy, rounding errors, and even the frequency of their appearance. Multiple approaches have been proposed in the literature to tackle the problem of semantic labeling of numeric values in existing tabular datasets. However, they also suffer from several shortcomings: closely coupled with entity-linking, rely on table context, need to profile the knowledge graph, and require manual training of the model. Above all, however, they all treat different types of numeric values evenly.

Regression kriging is a widely used hybrid approach of spatial variation that combines correlation between soil properties and environmental factors with spatial autocorrelation between soil observations. In this study, we compared four machine learning approaches (gradient boosting machine, multinarrative adaptive regression spline, random forest, and support vector machine) with regression kriging to predict the spatial variation of surface (0–30 cm) soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 250-m spatial resolution across the northern circumpolar permafrost region. We combined 2,374 soil profile observations (calibration datasets) with georeferenced datasets of environmental factors (climate, topography, land cover, bedrock geology, and soil types) to predict the spatial variation of surface SOC stocks. We evaluated the prediction accuracy at randomly selected sites (validation datasets) across the study area. We found that different techniques inferred different numbers of environmental factors and their relative importance for prediction of SOC stocks. Regression kriging produced lower prediction errors in comparison to multinarrative adaptive regression spline and support vector machine, and comparable prediction accuracy to gradient boosting machine and random forest. However, the ensemble median prediction of SOC stocks obtained from all four machine learning techniques showed highest prediction accuracy. Although the use of different approaches in spatial prediction of soil properties will depend on the availability of soil and environmental datasets and computational resources, we conclude that the ensemble median prediction obtained from multiple machine learning approaches provides greater spatial details and produces the highest prediction accuracy. Thus an ensemble prediction approach can be a better choice than any single prediction technique for predicting the spatial variation of SOC stocks."

Satellite-based observations offered the first opportunity to estimate depth-integrated net primary production (NPP) at a global scale, but early modeling approaches could not effectively address variability in algal physiology, particularly the effects of photoacclimation on changes in cellular chlorophyll. Here, a previously developed photoacclimation model was used to derive depth-resolved estimates of phytoplankton division rate (μ) and NPP.

We observed favorable growth conditions for phytoplankton throughout the annual cycle in the subtropical western North Atlantic. As a result, high rates of μ are sustained year-round resulting in a strong coupling between growth and loss processes and a more moderate spring bloom compared to the high-latitude subarctic region. Considerable light limitation was observed in the subarctic province during the winter, which resulted in divergent growth dynamics, stronger decoupling from grazing pressure and a taxonomically distinct phytoplankton community. This study demonstrates how detailed knowledge of phytoplankton division rate furthers our understanding of global carbon cycling by providing insight into the resulting influence on phytoplankton taxonomy and the loss processes that dictate the fate of fixed carbon."

The present study is aimed at the investigation of antiviral action of several groups of phytoconstituents against SARS-CoV-2 using a molecular docking approach to inhibit Main Protease (Mpro) (PDB code: 6LU7) and spike (S) glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 (PDB code: 6M0J) of SARS-CoV-2. For binding affinity evaluation, the docking scores were calculated using the Extra Precision (XP) protocol of the Glide docking module of Maestro. CovDock was also used to investigate covalent docking. The OPLS3e force field was used in simulations. The docking score was calculated by preferring the conformation of the ligand that has the lowest binding free energy (best pose). The results are indicative of better potential of solanine, acetoside, and rutin, as Mpro and spike glycoprotein RBD dual inhibitors. Acetoside and curcumin were found to inhibit Mpro covalently. Curcumin also possessed all the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters in the range.

Representation learning of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) aims to map entities and relationships into a continuous low-dimensional vector space. Conventional KG embedding methods (such as TransE and ConvE) utilize only KG triplets and thus suffer from structure sparsity. Some recent works address this issue by incorporating auxiliary texts of entities, typically entity descriptions. However, these methods usually focus only on local consecutive word sequences, but seldom explicitly use global word co-occurrence information in a corpus. In this paper, we propose to model the whole auxiliary text corpus with a graph and present an end-to-end text-graph enhanced KG embedding model, named Teger. Specifically, we model the auxiliary texts with a heterogeneous entity-word graph (called text-graph), which entails both local and global semantic relationships among entities and words. We then apply graph convolutional networks to learn informative entity embeddings that aggregate high-order neighborhood information.

Recent research has shown that minorities are suffering much more the effects of the pandemia because their lack of access to services and in a much wider perspective, to education and welfare. We will show that, during the COVID crisis, despite lockdown measures, various actions at the formal political level (from the Italian Deaf Association) and at the informal level (from the members of the community) promoted sign language and the Deaf community within the hearing majority. In particular, we will analyse how social networks were exploited at the grassroot level in order to promote social cohesion and share information about the coronavirus emergency and how the Deaf community shaped the interpreting services on the public media. The role of social networks, however, has gone far beyond the emergency as it has allowed deaf people to create a new virtual space where it was possible to discuss the appropriateness of various linguistic choices related to the COVID lexicon and to argue about the various interpreting services. Furthermore, in such emergency, the interpreting services were shaped following the needs expressed by the Deaf community with the results of an increased visibility of Italian sign language (LIS) and empowerment of the community. Materials spontaneously produced by members of the Deaf Italian community (conferences, debates, fairy tales, and entertainment games) were selected, as well as materials produced by LIS interpreters committed to guaranteeing access to information. By highlighting the strategies that a minority group put in place to deal with the COVID-19 emergency, we can better understand the peculiarities of that community, creating a bridge between worlds that often travel in parallel for respecting the peculiarities of each other (deaf and hearing communities)."

The pandemic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak increases the likelihood of infection from humans of susceptible animal species that, thus, could become secondary viral hosts and even disease reservoirs. We present evidence of spillover infection of wild mustelids by reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in a Eurasian river otter found near a water reservoir in the Valencian Community (Spain). We detected the virus using two different commercial RTqPCR assays on RNA extracted from the nasopharynx (swabbing) and from lung tissue and mediastinal lymph node homogenates. The corresponding samples from two additional otters from distant sites tested negative in identical assays. The diagnosis in the positive otter was confirmed by two-tube RT-PCR assay in which RNA was first retrotranscribed, and then specific regions of the spike (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>), nucleocapsid (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>), and <jats:italic>ORF10</jats:italic> genes were separately amplified from the produced cDNA, followed by electrophoretic visualization and Sanger sequencing.

These changes, identified already in human patient samples, point to human origin of the virus, although their specific combination was unique. These findings, together with our previous report of SARS-CoV-2 infection of feral American mink, highlight the need for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance of wild or feral mustelids to evaluate the risk that these animals could become SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs."

It is quite regrettable that people, particularly the deaf, still face a lot of challenges in acquiring an education. Their learning methods are different as compared to hearing people. They use Sign Language (SL) rather than natural language to communicate and learn. They are required to put a lot of effort into learning different concepts using conventional pedagogies. Therefore, there is a dire need for some assistive technology to improve their learn-ability and understandability. In the present study, 192 deaf participants aged 5–10 years were sampled from two special child institutes. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of a mobile interface through a developed mobile application for learning basic mathematical concepts using Pakistan Sign Language (PSL). The present study bridges the gap between the technology-based method and conventional teaching methods, which are used for teaching mathematical concepts using PSL. The participants were divided into two groups, that is, one group learned through conventional methods (flash cards and board) and the other group through the developed mobile application. The difference in the performance of both the groups was evaluated by conducting quizzes. The quiz results were analyzed by the Z-test and ANOVA. The findings revealed that the Experimental Group (EG) participants, who were instructed by our mobile application showed higher proficiency in the quizzes as compared to the Control Group (CG). EG participants performed better than CG by 12% in the quizzes. A gender based difference was also observed for the quiz scores. Male participants in category C (word problem learning) performed 2.7% better than females in the EG and 2.5% better in the CG. Moreover, a significant difference was also observed in the time taken by participants in both groups to complete the quizzes. CG participants took 20 min longer than EG participants to complete the quizzes. The results of the ANOVA showed that the quiz scores were directly affected by the mode of teaching used for participants in both groups."

State-of-the-art recommendation algorithms—especially the collaborative filtering (CF)- based approaches with shallow or deep models—usually work with various unstructured information sources for recommendation, such as textual reviews, visual images, and various implicit or explicit feedbacks. Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches, they have been largely ignored recently due to the availability of vast amounts of data and the learning power of many complex models. However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized recommendation systems. When the explicit knowledge about users and items is considered for recommendation, the system could provide highly customized recommendations based on users’ historical behaviors and the knowledge is helpful for providing informed explanations regarding the recommended items. A great challenge for using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrate large-scale structured and unstructured data, while taking advantage of collaborative filtering for highly accurate performance. Recent achievements in knowledge-base embedding (KBE) sheds light on this problem, which makes it possible to learn user and item representations while preserving the structure of their relationship with external knowledge for explanation. In this work, we propose to explain knowledge-base embeddings for explainable recommendation. Specifically, we propose a knowledge-base representation learning framework to embed heterogeneous entities for recommendation, and based on the embedded knowledge base, a soft matching algorithm is proposed to generate personalized explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets verified the superior recommendation performance and the explainability power of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines."

Conceptualization is the basic task for ontology building. Concepts are identified, and then they are linked through their semantic relationships. Recently, ontologies have constituted a crucial part of modern semantic webs because they can convert a web of documents into a web of things. Although ontology learning generally occupies a large space in computer science, Arabic ontology learning, in particular, is underdeveloped due to the Arabic language’s nature as well as the profundity required in this domain. The previously published research on Arabic ontology learning from text falls into three categories: developing manually hand-crafted rules, using ordinary supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms, or a hybrid of these two approaches. The model proposed in this work contributes to Arabic ontology learning in two ways. First, a text mining algorithm is proposed for extracting concepts and their semantic relations from text documents. The algorithm calculates the concept frequency weights using the term frequency weights. Then, it calculates the weights of concept similarity using the information of the ontology structure, involving (1) the concept’s path distance, (2) the concept’s distribution layer, and (3) the mutual parent concept’s distribution layer. Then, feature mapping is performed by assigning the concepts’ similarities to the concept features. Second, a hybrid genetic-whale optimization algorithm was proposed to optimize ontology learning from Arabic text. The operator of the G-WOA is a hybrid operator integrating GA’s mutation, crossover, and selection processes with the WOA’s processes (encircling prey, attacking of bubble-net, and searching for prey) to fulfill the balance between both exploitation and exploration, and to find the solutions that exhibit the highest fitness. For evaluating the performance of the ontology learning approach, extensive comparisons are conducted using different Arabic corpora and bio-inspired optimization algorithms. Furthermore, two publicly available non-Arabic corpora are used to compare the efficiency of the proposed approach with those of other languages. The results reveal that the proposed genetic-whale optimization algorithm outperforms the other compared algorithms across all the Arabic corpora in terms of precision, recall, and F-score measures. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of ontology learning from Arabic and non-Arabic texts in terms of these three measures."

For LU mapping, we tested three machine learning models algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Dimensional Trees K-Nearest Neighbors (KDTree-KNN) and Minimum Distance Classification (MDC). According to our research, the RF classification provided a better result than other classification models. RF classification exhibited the best values of overall accuracy, kappa, recall, precision and RMSE, with 99.54%, 0.98%, 0.98%, 0.98% and 0.23%, respectively. However, low precision was observed for the MDC method (RMSE = 1.15). The results were more intriguing since they highlighted the value of the bare soil index as a covariate for LU mapping. Our results suggest that Sentinel-2 combined with RF classification is efficient for creating a LU map."

However, farmers are still reluctant in the use of intercropping practices since there is a huge knowledge gap regarding the time of sowing, sowing ratio, crop stand density, and cultivar choice. In this study, we carried out a 3-year field experiment in Central Italy to assess the effect of relay intercropping on the agronomic performance and competitiveness of winter durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf. cv. Minosse) and spring lentil (Lens culinaris Medik. cv. Elsa) under a low-input management system, comparing different crop stand types (monocrop vs. intercrop) and target plant densities (350 plants m2—full dose vs. 116 plants m2—1/3 dose). The results revealed that intercropping increased grain yield compared to monocropping: significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) against both monocrops in 2021 and non-significantly against durum wheat in 2019 and 2020. Yield advantage in both intercropping systems ranged between 164 and 648%. Durum wheat competitiveness was stronger in 2019 and 2021, while lentil was the most competitive component in 2020. Intercropping favored P accumulation in durum wheat shoots. There was no difference in grain yield of both crops between the highly- and lowly-dense system in 2020 and 2021. Both intercropping strategies were as effective as mechanical hoeing in controlling weeds and proved beneficial in stabilizing lentil productivity. Further economic analysis capturing the additional costs incurred in intercropping and mechanical weeding would highlight the magnitude of profitability of these systems."

This study aimed to explore the potential of combining a multivariate method and spectral variable selection for soil SOM and TN estimation using MIR spectroscopy. Five hundred and ten topsoil samples were collected from Quzhou County, Hebei Province, China, and their SOM and TN contents and reflectance spectra were measured using DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform in the mid-infrared range, MIR, wavenumber: 4000–400 cm−1; wavelength: 2500–25,000 nm). Two multivariate methods (partial least-squares regression, PLSR; multiple linear regression, MLR) combined with two variable selection techniques (stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, sCARS; bootstrapping soft shrinkage approach, BOSS) were used for model calibration. The MLR model combined with the sCARS method yielded the most accurate estimation result for both SOM (Rp2 = 0.72 and RPD = 1.89) and TN (Rp2 = 0.84 and RPD = 2.50). Out of the 2382 wavenumbers in a full spectrum, sCARS determined that only 31 variables were important for SOM estimation (accounting for 1.30% of all variables) and 27 variables were important for TN estimation (accounting for 1.13% of all variables). The results demonstrated that sCARS was a highly efficient approach for extracting information on wavenumbers and mitigating redundant wavenumbers. In addition, the current study indicated that MLR, which is simpler than PLSR, when combined with spectral variable selection, can achieve high-precision prediction of SOM and TN content. As such, DRIFT-MIR spectroscopy coupled with MLR and sCARS is a good alternative for estimating the SOM and TN of soils."

Therefore, conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as an alternative to improve soil fertility and productivity. Hence the aim was to investigate the effects of tillage systems, fertilization, and cropping patterns on selected soil chemical properties (pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity) and identify which cropping pattern maximizes stover and grain maize–legume productivity and land use. A two-year (2016/17–2017/18) field experiment in a loamy sand soil was conducted at Nhacoongo Research Station, southern Mozambique. Two tillage systems (conservation (CA) and conventional tillage (CT)), two fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), and seven cropping patterns (four sole crops and three maize–legume intercrops) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with split–split plot arrangement and replicated four times. CA practices resulted in significantly higher soil chemical properties and increased stover and grain yields as compared to CT practices, but fertilization demonstrated insignificant effects on soil chemical properties and significant influences on stover and grain yield of maize and legumes. Cropping patterns induced no significant effect on soil chemical properties and either stover or grain yield. Estimated indices like land equivalent ratio (1.18–2.67) and competitive ratio index (0.01–1.72) confirmed the advantage of intercropping against sole cropping. This is largely supported by the estimated values of aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient. Smallholder farmers can therefore benefit by adopting CA."

Research has shown that an animal’s welfare is highly dependent on how various individual animal factors (e.g., species traits, genetics, temperament and previous experience) interact with environmental features (e.g., social grouping, enclosure design and sensory environment). One prominent feature of the zoo environment is the presence of visitors. Visitor contact can be unpredictable and intense, particularly in terms of auditory and visual interaction. Depending on an animal’s perception of this interaction, visitors can have either negative, neutral or positive impacts on zoo animal behaviour and welfare. This paper reviews the literature on the implications and potential opportunities of human-zoo animal interactions on animal behaviour and welfare, with the aim of stimulating interest, understanding and exploration of this important subject. The literature to date presents a mixed range of findings on the topic. It is possible this variation in the responses of zoo animals to visitors may be due to species-specific differences, the nature and intensity of the visitor interactions, enclosure design, and individual animal characteristics. Analysing these studies and better understanding animal preferences and motivations can provide insight into what animals find negatively and positively reinforcing in terms of visitor contact in a specific zoo setting. This understanding can then be applied to either safeguard welfare in cases where visitors can have a negative impact, or, conversely, it can be applied to highlight opportunities to encourage animal-visitor interaction in situations where animals experience positive emotions associated with visitor interaction."

The pipeline combines Semantic Web and natural language processing technologies, which make data understandable by computer agents, empowering the development of final user applications for literature searches. This workflow consists of (1) RDF generation, including metadata and contents; (2) semantic annotation of the content; and (3) property graph population by adding domain knowledge from ontologies, in addition to the previously generated RDF data describing the articles. This pipeline was applied to a set of 127 agriculture articles, generating a knowledge graph implemented in Neo4j, publicly available on Docker.

Currently, most relation extraction modules are more focused on the extraction of local mention-level relations—usually from short volumes of text. However, in most cases, the most vital and important relations are those that are described in length and detail. In this research, we propose GREG: A Global level Relation Extractor model using knowledge graph embeddings for document-level inputs. The model uses vector representations of mention-level ‘local’ relation’s to construct knowledge graphs that can represent the input document. The knowledge graph is then used to predict global level relations from documents or large bodies of text. The proposed model is largely divided into two modules which are synchronized during their training. Thus, each of the model’s modules is designed to deal with local relations and global relations separately. This allows the model to avoid the problem of struggling against loss of information due to too much information crunched into smaller sized representations when attempting global level relation extraction. Through evaluation, we have shown that the proposed model yields high performances in both predicting global level relations and local level relations consistently."

Since they store many facts, they are regarded as core resources for many natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, they are not normally complete and have many missing facts. Such missing facts keep them from being used in diverse applications in spite of their usefulness. Therefore, it is significant to complete knowledge bases. Knowledge graph embedding is one of the promising approaches to completing a knowledge base and thus many variants of knowledge graph embedding have been proposed. It maps all entities and relations in knowledge base onto a low dimensional vector space. Then, candidate facts that are plausible in the space are determined as missing facts. However, any single knowledge graph embedding is insufficient to complete a knowledge base. As a solution to this problem, this paper defines knowledge base completion as a ranking task and proposes a committee-based knowledge graph embedding model for improving the performance of knowledge base completion. Since each knowledge graph embedding has its own idiosyncrasy, we make up a committee of various knowledge graph embeddings to reflect various perspectives. After ranking all candidate facts according to their plausibility computed by the committee, the top-k facts are chosen as missing facts. Our experimental results on two data sets show that the proposed model achieves higher performance than any single knowledge graph embedding and shows robust performances regardless of k. These results prove that the proposed model considers various perspectives in measuring the plausibility of candidate facts."

SENTINEL is specifically designed to minimize the computational and traffic overheads caused by certificate exchanges and asymmetric cryptography computations that are typically required for authentication protocols. SENTINEL initially generates a flight session key for a drone having a flight plan and registers the flight session key and its flight plan into a centralized database that can be accessed by ground stations. The registered flight session key is then used as the message authentication code key to authenticate the drone by any ground station while the drone is flying. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we implemented a prototype of SENTINEL with ECDSA, PBKDF2 and HMAC-SHA256.

One amazing belief was to be buried with funerary statuettes to help the deceased carry out his/her tasks in the underworld. These funerary statuettes, mainly known as shabtis, were produced in different materials and were usually inscribed in hieroglyphs with formulas including the name of the deceased. Shabtis are important archaeological objects which can help to identify the owners, their jobs, ranks or their families. They are also used for tomb dating because, depending on different elements: color, formula, tools, wig, hand positions, etc., it is possible to associate them to a concrete type or period of time. Shabtis are spread all over the world, in excavations, museums or private collections, and many of them have not been studied and identified because this process requires a deep study and reading of the hieroglyphs. Our system is able to solve this problem using two different YOLO v3 networks for detecting the figure itself and the hieroglyphic names, which provide identification and cataloguing. Until now, there has been no other work on the detection and identification of shabtis. In addition, a semantic approach has been followed, creating an ontology to connect our system with the semantic metadata aggregator, Europeana, linking our results with known shabtis in different museums.

The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an effective model for accurate relation classification, which models the dependency tree of textual instances to extract the semantic features of relation mentions. Previous GCN based methods treat each node equally. However, the contribution of different words to express a certain relation is different, especially the entity mentions in the sentence. In this paper, a novel GCN based relation classifier is propose, which treats the entity nodes as two global nodes in the dependency tree. These two global nodes directly connect with other nodes, which can aggregate information from the whole tree with only one convolutional layer. In this way, the method can not only simplify the complexity of the model, but also generate expressive relation representation. Experimental results on two widely used data sets, SemEval-2010 Task 8 and TACRED, show that our model outperforms all the compared baselines in this paper, which illustrates that the model can effectively utilize the dependencies between nodes and improve the performance of relation classification."

Improper and late handling of a diabetic foot patient can result in an amputation of the patient’s foot. Early detection of DFU symptoms can be observed using thermal imaging with a computer-assisted classifier. Previous study of DFU detection using thermal image only achieved 97% of accuracy, and it has to be improved. This article proposes a novel framework for DFU classification based on thermal imaging using deep neural networks and decision fusion. Here, decision fusion combines the classification result from a parallel classifier. We used the convolutional neural network (CNN) model of ShuffleNet and MobileNetV2 as the baseline classifier. In developing the classifier model, firstly, the MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNet were trained using plantar thermogram datasets. Then, the classification results of those two models were fused using a novel decision fusion method to increase the accuracy rate. The proposed framework achieved 100% accuracy in classifying the DFU thermal images in binary classes of positive and negative cases. The accuracy of the proposed Decision Fusion (DF) was increased by about 3.4% from baseline ShuffleNet and MobileNetV2. Overall, the proposed framework outperformed in classifying the images compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning and the traditional machine-learning-based classifier."

However, anomalies in time series often lack strict definitions and labels, and existing methods often suffer from the need for rigid hypotheses, the inability to handle high-dimensional data, and highly time-consuming calculation costs. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the distribution pattern of normal data, detecting anomalies by comparing the reconstructed normal data with the original data. However, it is difficult for GANs to extract contextual information from time series data. In this paper, we propose a new method, Transformer-based GAN for Anomaly Detection of Time Series Data (TGAN-AD), The transformer-based generators of TGAN-AD can extract contextual features of time series data to prompt the performance. TGAN-AD’s discriminator can also assist in determining abnormal data. Anomaly scores are calculated through both the generator and the discriminator. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on three public datasets.

The effect of lockdown, which saw a 32% reduction in traffic volume and a 15% increase in average speed on Marylebone Road, resulted in lower PM10 and PM2.5 traffic increments and brake wear concentrations but similar tyre and resuspension concentrations, confirming that factors that determine non-exhaust emissions are complex. Brake wear was found to be the highest average non-exhaust emission source. In addition, results indicate that non-exhaust emission factors were dependent upon speed and road surface wetness conditions. Further statistical analysis incorporating a wider variability in vehicle mix, speeds, and meteorological conditions, as well as advanced source apportionment of the PM measurement data, were undertaken to enhance our understanding of these important vehicle sources."

The variations observed during the first confinement period in the city of Aosta (−61% NO, −43% NO2, +5% O3, +9% PM2.5, −12% PM10, relative to average 2015–2019 conditions) are attributed to the competing effects of air pollution lockdown-induced changes (−74%, −52%, +18%, −13%, −27%, relative to the counterfactual scenario for 2020 provided by a predictive statistical model trained on past measurements) and meteorology (+52%, +18%, −11%, +25%, +20%, relative to average conditions). These changes agree well with the ones obtained from a chemical transport model with modified emissions according to the restrictions. With regard to column-integrated quantities and vertical profiles, the NO2 column density decreases by &gt;20% due to the lockdown, whereas tropospheric aerosols are mainly influenced by large-scale dynamics (transport of secondary particles from the Po basin and mineral dust from the Sahara desert and the Caspian Sea), except a shallow layer about 500 m thick close to the surface, possibly sensitive to curtailed emissions (especially exhaust and non-exhaust particles from road traffic and fugitive emissions from the industry)."

To reveal the impact of the electricity generation mix on carbon emissions from vehicles, this paper compares the life cycle carbon emissions of BEVs with ICEVs considering the regional disparity of electricity generation mix in China. According to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis and regional electricity carbon intensity, this study demonstrates that BEVs in the region with high penetration of thermal power produce more CO2 emissions, while BEVs in the region with higher penetration of renewable energy have better environmental performance in carbon emission reduction. For instance, in the region with over 50% penetration of renewable energy, a BEV can reduce more CO2 (18.32 t) compared to an ICEV. Therefore, the regions with high carbon emissions from vehicles need to increase the proportion of renewable generation as a priority rather than promoting BEVs."

In this paper, we propose an interpretable novel neural network-based model, the hierarchical co-attention selection network (HCSN), to predict whether the source post is fake, as well as an explanation that emphasizes important comments and particular words. The key insight of the HCSN model is to incorporate the Gumbel–Max trick in the hierarchical co-attention selection mechanism that captures sentence-level and word-level information from the source post and comments following the sequence of words–sentences–words–event. In addition, HCSN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability—it provides a conscious explanation of how it reaches certain results by selecting comments and highlighting words. According to the experiments conducted on real-world datasets, our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods and generated reasonable explanations."

To enhance the reasoning and data handling of concepts in scientific papers, finding the best fitting ontology regarding description of the concepts contained in a text corpus. The approach presented in this work attempts to solve this by selection of a representative text paragraph from a set of scientific papers, which are used as data set. Then, using a pre-trained and fine-tuned Transformer, the paragraph is embedded into a vector space. Finally, the embedded vector becomes classified with respect to its relevance regarding a selected target ontology. To construct representative embeddings, we experiment with different training pipelines for natural language processing models. Those embeddings in turn are later used in the task of matching text to ontology. Finally, the result is assessed by compressing and visualizing the latent space and exploring the mappings between text fragments from a database and the set of chosen ontologies. To confirm the differences in behavior of the proposed ontology mapper models, we test five statistical hypotheses about their relative performance on ontology classification.

These classifiers are, in detail, the Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron. Application of these classifiers in a domain of scientific texts concerning catalysis research and respective ontologies, the suitability of the classifiers is evaluated, where the best result was achieved by the SVM classifier."

The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment.

Breast lesions were indicated with a bounding box and labeled as benign or malignant by a radiologist, while the AI system was trained to detect and calculate possibilities of malignancy using RetinaNet. The AI system was analyzed using test sets of 13 normal, 20 benign, and 52 malignant cases. Four human readers also scored these test data with and without the assistance of the AI system for the possibility of a malignancy in each breast.

Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia.

Since KG construction usually involves automatic mechanisms with less human supervision, it inevitably brings in plenty of noises to KGs. However, most conventional KG embedding approaches inappropriately assume that all facts in existing KGs are completely correct and ignore noise issues, which brings about potentially serious errors. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learn embeddings with triple trustiness on KGs, which takes possible noises into consideration. Specifically, we calculate the trustiness value of triples according to the rich and relatively reliable information from large amounts of entity type instances and entity descriptions in KGs. In addition, we present a cross-entropy based loss function for model optimization. In experiments, we evaluate our models on KG noise detection, KG completion and classification. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed model can learn better embeddings than all baselines on noisy KGs."

This paper presents a novel, context-aware, deep-learning-driven, Persian sentiment analysis approach. Specifically, the proposed deep-learning-driven automated feature-engineering approach classifies Persian movie reviews as having positive or negative sentiments. Two deep learning algorithms, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM), are applied and compared with our previously proposed manual-feature-engineering-driven, SVM-based approach.

Fast prevention means lower repair costs and losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms that automate the process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure prevention systems. Therefore, many machine learning models have been designed to address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with some generative adversarial elements. This work shows a framework that incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly detection scores of new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution strategies for evolving an ensemble model, in which every single model works on a subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimize the architecture and hyperparameters such as the window size, the number of layers, and the layer depths. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully automated mode. We ran tests on the SWAT and WADI datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection model is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy."

However, the reduction of compactness and continuity of thinner CdS always deteriorates the device performance. In this work, transparent Al2O3 films with different thicknesses, deposited by using atomic layer deposition (ALD), were utilized as buffer layers between the front electrode transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and CdS layers to solve this problem, and then, thin-film solar cells with a structure of TCO/Al2O3/CdS/CdTe/BC/Ni were fabricated. The characteristics of the ALD-Al2O3 films were studied by UV–visible transmittance spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The light and dark J–V performances of solar cells were also measured by specific instrumentations. The transmittance measurement conducted on the TCO/Al2O3 films verified that the transmittance of TCO/Al2O3 were comparable to that of single TCO layer, meaning that no extra absorption loss occurred when Al2O3 buffer layers were introduced into cells. Furthermore, due to the advantages of the ALD method, the ALD-Al2O3 buffer layers formed an extremely continuous and uniform coverage on the substrates to effectively fill and block the tiny leakage channels in CdS/CdTe polycrystalline films and improve the characteristics of the interface between TCO and CdS. However, as the thickness of alumina increased, the negative effects of cells were gradually exposed, especially the increase of the series resistance (Rs) and the more serious “roll-over” phenomenon. Finally, the cell conversion efficiency (η) of more than 13.0% accompanied by optimized uniformity performances was successfully achieved corresponding to the 10 nm thick ALD-Al2O3 thin film."

Different triggers will have various effects on different customers and lead to difficulties in constructing an adequate prediction model due to non-stationary and uncertain characteristics in load variations. This paper proposes an open-ended model of short-term load forecasting (STLF) which has general prediction ability to capture the non-linear relationship between the load demand and the exogenous inputs. The prediction method uses the whale optimization algorithm, discrete wavelet transform, and multiple linear regression model (WOA-DWT-MLR model) to predict both system load and aggregated load of power consumers. WOA is used to optimize the best combination of detail and approximation signals from DWT to construct an optimal MLR model. The proposed model is validated with both the system-side data set and the end-user data set for Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-NE) and smart meter load data, respectively, based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower prediction error than existing methods and can have consistent prediction of non-stationary load conditions that exist in both test systems.

The two case studies suggest that HESs are potential solutions to reduce the dependence of rural villages on fossil fuels and viable mechanisms to bring electrical power to isolated communities in Ecuador. Our results reveal that not only from the economic but also from the environmental point of view, for the case of the Galapagos province, a hybrid energy system with a PV–wind–battery configuration and a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) equal to 0.36 $/kWh is the optimal energy supply system.

Such tools generally rely on existing transcriptomic datasets or curated databases of cell type defining genes, while the application of scalable natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance analysis workflows has not been adequately explored. Here we deployed an NLP framework to objectively quantify associations between a comprehensive set of over 20,000 human protein-coding genes and over 500 cell type terms across over 26 million biomedical documents. The resultant gene-cell type associations (GCAs) are significantly stronger between a curated set of matched cell type-marker pairs than the complementary set of mismatched pairs (Mann Whitney p = 6.15 × 10−76, r = 0.24; cohen’s D = 2.6). Building on this, we developed an augmented annotation algorithm (single cell Annotation via Literature Encoding, or scALE) that leverages GCAs to categorize cell clusters identified in scRNA-seq datasets, and we tested its ability to predict the cellular identity of 133 clusters from nine datasets of human breast, colon, heart, joint, ovary, prostate, skin, and small intestine tissues. With the optimized settings, the true cellular identity matched the top prediction in 59% of tested clusters and was present among the top five predictions for 91% of clusters. scALE slightly outperformed an existing method for reference data driven automated cluster annotation, and we demonstrate that integration of scALE can meaningfully improve the annotations derived from such methods. Further, contextualization of differential expression analyses with these GCAs highlights poorly characterized markers of well-studied cell types, such as CLIC6 and DNASE1L3 in retinal pigment epithelial cells and endothelial cells, respectively. Taken together, this study illustrates for the first time how the systematic application of a literature-derived knowledge graph can expedite and enhance the annotation and interpretation of scRNA-seq data."

The current study examined the national prevalence of bullying victimization and its correlates among in-school adolescents in Ghana. (2) Methods: A sample of 1342 in-school adolescents in Ghana (55.2% males; 44.8% females) aged 12–18 was drawn from the 2012 Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) for the analysis. Self-reported bullying victimization “during the last 30 days, on how many days were you bullied?” was used as the central criterion variable. Three-level analyses using descriptive, Pearson chi-square, and binary logistic regression were performed. Results of the regression analysis were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) at 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with a statistical significance pegged at p &lt; 0.05. (3) Results: Bullying victimization was prevalent among 41.3% of the in-school adolescents. Pattern of results indicates that adolescents in SHS 3 [aOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.25, 0.47] and SHS 4 [aOR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.44] were less likely to be victims of bullying. Adolescents who had sustained injury [aOR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.63, 2.73] were more likely to be bullied compared to those who had not sustained any injury. The odds of bullying victimization were higher among adolescents who had engaged in physical fight [aOR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.42, 2.25] and those who had been physically attacked [aOR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.32, 2.27]. Similarly, adolescents who felt lonely were more likely to report being bullied [aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.08] as against those who did not feel lonely. Additionally, adolescents with a history of suicide attempts were more likely to be bullied [aOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.38] and those who used marijuana had higher odds of bullying victimization [aOR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.10, 10.24]. (4) Conclusions: Current findings require the need for policy makers and school authorities in Ghana to design and implement policies and anti-bullying interventions (e.g., Social Emotional Learning (SEL), Emotive Behavioral Education (REBE), Marijuana Cessation Therapy (MCT)) focused on addressing behavioral issues, mental health and substance abuse among in-school adolescents."

However, this can pose a challenge in data-scarce environments where data gaps are widespread. In such situations, recurring data gaps can lead to unfavorable outcomes such as loss of critical information, ineffective model calibration, inaccurate timing of peak flows, and biased statistical analysis in various applications. Despite its importance, predicting monthly streamflow can be a complex task due to its connection to random dynamics and uncertain phenomena, posing significant challenges. This study introduces an ensemble machine-learning regression framework for modeling and predicting monthly streamflow time series with a high degree of accuracy. The framework utilizes historical data from multiple monthly streamflow datasets in the same region to predict missing monthly streamflow data. The framework selects the best features from all available gap-free monthly streamflow time-series combinations and identifies the optimal model from a pool of 12 machine-learning models, including random forest regression, gradient boosting regression, and extra trees regressor, among others. The model selection is based on cross-validation train-and-test set scores, as well as the coefficient of determination. We conducted modeling on 26 monthly streamflow time series and found that the gradient boosting regressor with bagging regressor produced the highest accuracy in 7 of the 26 instances. Across all instances, the models using this method exhibited an overall accuracy range of 0.9737 to 0.9968. Additionally, the use of either a bagging regressor or an AdaBoost regressor improved both the tree-based and gradient-based models, resulting in these methods accounting for nearly 80% of the best models. Between January 1960 and December 2021, an average of 40% of the monthly streamflow data was missing for each of the 26 stations. Notably, two crucial stations located in the economically significant lower Athabasca Basin River in Alberta province, Canada, had approximately 70% of their monthly streamflow data missing. To address this issue, we employed our framework to accurately extend the missing data for all 26 stations. These accurate extensions also allow for further analysis, including grouping stations with similar monthly streamflow behavior using Pearson correlation."

To find and examine the extremities and IDF curves, daily rainfall data from 1966 to 2018 is used. The IDF curves are created for a variety of return periods and climate scenarios in three terrain variabilities. This research examines various distributions to estimate the maximum rainfall for several metrological stations with varying return periods and terrain conditions. Three main zones are identified based on ground elevation variability and IDF distributions from upstream in the eastern mountainous area to downstream in the western coastal area. These IDF curves can be used to identify vulnerable hotspot areas in arid areas such as the Wadi AL-Lith, and flood mitigation steps can be suggested to minimize flood risk."

These tasks are important challenges in healthcare. Analyzing user messages in social media networks such as Twitter can provide opportunities to detect and manage public health events. Twitter provides a broad range of short messages that contain interesting information for information extraction. In this paper, we present a Health-Related Named Entity Recognition (HNER) task using healthcare-domain ontology that can recognize health-related entities from large numbers of user messages from Twitter. For this task, we employ a deep learning architecture which is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with little feature engineering. To achieve our goal, we collected a large number of Twitter messages containing health-related information, and detected biomedical entities from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). A bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model learned rich context information, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to produce character-level features. The conditional random field (CRF) model predicted a sequence of labels that corresponded to a sequence of inputs, and the Viterbi algorithm was used to detect health-related entities from Twitter messages. We provide comprehensive results giving valuable insights for identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications. The BiLSTM-CRF model achieved a precision of 93.99%, recall of 73.31%, and F1-score of 81.77% for disease or syndrome HNER; a precision of 90.83%, recall of 81.98%, and F1-score of 87.52% for sign or symptom HNER; and a precision of 94.85%, recall of 73.47%, and F1-score of 84.51% for pharmacologic substance named entities.

The results show that adolescents’ interest in broad science topics can predict perceived ICT competence. Their interest in broad science topics and perceived ICT competence can predict environmental awareness in both countries. However, there is difference in predicting environmental optimism. Singaporean students’ interest in broad science topics and their perceived ICT competences are positive predictors, whereas environmental awareness is a negative predictor.

Firms have to make decisions by comprehensively considering the cost and the important intangible performance of suppliers. This paper uses an analytic network process–integer programming (ANP–IP) model based on a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to solve the above issues by first evaluating and then optimizing them. The carbon embedded in components, which can be used to reflect the carbon competitiveness of a supplier, is integrated into the ANP–IP model. In addition, an international large-scale electronic equipment manufacturer in China is used to validate the model. Different scenarios involving different carbon prices are designed to analyze whether China’s current ETS drives firms to choose more low-carbon suppliers. The results show that current carbon constraints are not stringent enough to drive firms to select low-carbon suppliers. A more stringent ETS with a higher carbon price could facilitate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The analysis of the firm’s total cost and of the total cost composition indicates that the impact of a more stringent ETS on the firm results mainly from indirect costs instead of direct costs. The indirect cost is caused by the suppliers’ transfer of part of the low-carbon investment in the product, and arises from buying carbon permits with high carbon prices. Implications revealed by the model analysis are discussed to provide guidance to suppliers regarding the balance between soft competitiveness and low-carbon production capability and to provide guidance to the firm on how to cooperate with suppliers to achieve a mutually beneficial situation."

Methods: We used the Chinese version of depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS-21) to assess the mental health and the impact of events scale—revised (IES-R) to assess the COVID-19 psychological impact. Results: The students with hearing loss are frustrated with their disability and particularly vulnerable to stress symptoms, but they are highly endurable in mitigating this negative impact on coping with their well-being and responsibilities. They are also more resilient psychologically but less resistant mentally to the pandemic impacts than the students with normal hearing. Their mental and psychological response to the pandemic is associated with more related factors and variables than that of the students with normal hearing is. Conclusions: To safeguard the welfare of society, timely information on the pandemic, essential services for communication disorders, additional assistance and support in mental counseling should be provided to the vulnerable persons with hearing loss that are more susceptible to a public health emergency."

The evaluation accounts for the meteorology of the period. Daily and sub-daily analysis of aerosol and ozone records show that the territory was repeatedly affected by episodes of pollutants from outer regions. Three episodes of PM10 and ten of PM2.5 were caused by transported anthropogenic European sulfates, African dust, and wildland fires. The region, with a varied orographic climatology, shows high and diverse industrial activity. Urban and interurban road traffic of the region decreased by 49% and 53%, respectively, whereas industrial activity showed a lower reduction of 20%. Consequently, the average concentrations of NO2 in the cities during the period fell to 12.4 µg·m−3 (−45%). Ozone showed up to five exceedances of the WHOAQG for the daily maximum 8-h average in both rural and urban sites, associated with transport through France and the Bay of Biscay, under periods of European blocking anticyclones. However, averages showed a moderate decrease (−11%) in rural environments, in line with the precursor reductions, and disparate changes in the cities, which reproduced the weekend effect of their historical records. The PM10 decreased less than expected (−10% and −21%, in the urban and rural environments, respectively), probably caused by the modest decrease of industrial activity around urban sites and favorable meteorology for secondary aerosol formation, which could also influence the lower changes observed in the PM2.5 (−1% and +3% at the urban and rural sites, respectively). Consequently, in a future low NOx traffic emission scenario, the inter-regional PM and ozone control will require actions across various sectors, including the industry and common pollution control strategies."

Remote sensing data have been widely applied for urban land cover mapping. However, obtaining land cover classification via optical remote sensing data alone is difficult due to spectral confusion. To reduce the confusion between dark impervious surface and water, the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Rader (SAR) data are synergistically combined with the Sentinel-2B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The novel support vector machine with composite kernels (SVM-CK) approach, which can exploit the spatial information, is proposed to process the combination of Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR data. The classification based on the fusion of Sentinel-2B and Sentinel-1A data yields an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.12% with a kappa coefficient (KA) of 0.89, superior to the classification results using Sentinel-2B MSI imagery and Sentinel-1A SAR imagery separately.

ResNet not only integrates spatial background information around the observed environmental covariates, but also reduces problems such as information loss, which undermines the integrity of information and reduces prediction uncertainty. To train the model, rectified linear units, mean squared error, and adaptive momentum estimation were used as the activation function, loss/cost function, and optimizer, respectively. The method was tested with Landsat5, the meteorological data from WorldClim, and the 1602 sampling points set from Xinxiang, China. The performance of the proposed LSM-ResNet was compared to a traditional machine learning algorithm, the random forest (RF) algorithm, and a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) were created to test both models. The results showed that the LSM-ResNet (RMSE = 6.40, R2 = 0.51) model outperformed the RF model in both the roots mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), and the training accuracy was significantly improved compared to RF (RMSE = 6.81, R2 = 0.46).

One of the major downfalls of the LULC technique is inherently linked to its need for ground truth data to cross-validate maps. This paper aimed at evaluating the efficiency of machine learning (ML) in limiting the use of ground truth data for LULC maps. This was accomplished by (1) extracting reliable LULC information from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 s images, (2) generating remote sensing indices used to train ML algorithms, and (3) comparing the results with ground truth data. The remote sensing indices that were tested include the difference vegetation index (DVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized built-up index (NDBI), the urban index (UI), and the normalized bare land index (NBLI). Extracted vegetation indices were evaluated on three ML algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbour (K-NN), and k dimensional-tree (KD-Tree). The accuracy of these algorithms was assessed with standard statistical measures and ground truth data randomly collected in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Results showed that high kappa coefficient values were achieved by K-NN (82% and 74%), KD-Tree (80% and 78%), and RF (83% and 73%) for Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 imagery, respectively. RF was a better classifier than K-NN and KD-Tree and had the highest overall accuracy with Sentinel-2A satellite images (92%).

CDR data are a rich geo-referenced source of user behaviour information. In this work, we perform an analysis of CDR data for the city of Milan that originate from Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge. A set of graphs is generated from aggregated CDR data, where each node represents a centroid of an RBS (Radio Base Station) polygon, and each edge represents aggregated telecom traffic between two RBSs. To explore the community structure, we apply a modularity-based algorithm. Community structure between days is highly dynamic, with variations in number, size and spatial distribution. One general rule observed is that communities formed over the urban core of the city are small in size and prone to dynamic change in spatial distribution, while communities formed in the suburban areas are larger in size and more consistent with respect to their spatial distribution. To evaluate the dynamics of change in community structure between days, we introduced different graph based and spatial community properties which contain latent footprint of human dynamics. We created land use profiles for each RBS polygon based on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Urban Atlas data set to quantify the correlation and predictivennes of human dynamics properties based on land use. The results reveal a strong correlation between some properties and land use which motivated us to further explore this topic. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the programming language Scala inside the Apache Spark engine to support the most computationally intensive tasks and in Python using the rich portfolio of data analytics and machine learning libraries for the less demanding tasks."

This raises the question of assessing the impact of a new infrastructure project on the community prior to its commencement—what type of technologies can potentially be used for creating a virtual representation of the city? How can a smart city be improved by utilizing these technologies? There are a wide range of technologies and applications available but understanding their function, interoperability, and compatibility with the community requires more discussion around system designs and architecture. These questions can be the basis of developing an agenda for further investigations. In particular, the need for advanced tools such as mobile scanners, Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Geospatial Augmented Reality apps, Light Detection, and Ranging in smart cities is discussed.

In this paper, a new generative question answering method based on knowledge graph is proposed, including three parts of knowledge vocabulary construction, data pre-processing, and answer generation. In the word list construction, BiLSTM-CRF is used to identify the entity in the source text, finding the triples contained in the entity, counting the word frequency, and constructing it. In the part of data pre-processing, a pre-trained language model BERT combining word frequency semantic features is adopted to obtain word vectors.

Most attempts to detect and classify false content focus only on using textual information. Multimodal approaches are less frequent and they typically classify news either as true or fake. In this work, we perform a fine-grained classification of fake news on the Fakeddit dataset, using both unimodal and multimodal approaches. Our experiments show that the multimodal approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combining text and image data achieves the best results, with an accuracy of 87%. Some fake news categories, such as Manipulated content, Satire, or False connection, strongly benefit from the use of images. Using images also improves the results of the other categories but with less impact.

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0. Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation."

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction."

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number—the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively.

However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care."

Land use/land cover classification maps as well as an urban sprawl matrix technique were used to analyze the geographical patterns and trends of urban sprawl. Six urban classes, namely, the primary urban core, secondary urban core, sub-urban fringe, scatter settlement, urban open space, and non-urban area, were determined for the exploration of urban landscape changes. Future scenarios of LULC for 2030 were predicted using a CA–Markov model. The study found that the built-up area had expanded in a considerably unpredictable manner, primarily at the expense of agricultural land. The increase in mangroves and grassland and shrub land proved the effectiveness of afforestation programs in improving vegetation coverage in the study area. The investigation of urban landscape alteration revealed that the primary urban core expanded from the core districts, namely, the Central, South, and East districts, and a new urban secondary core emerged in Malir in 2020.

Remotely sensed images combined with supervised classification are common to define land use, but high-performance classifiers remain difficult to achieve, due to the presence of model hyperparameters. Conventional approaches rely on manual adjustment, which is time consuming and often unsatisfying. Therefore, the goal of this study has been to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for the generation of land use/cover maps from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in selected humid and arid (three study sites each) climatic regions of Iran. For supervised SVM classification, we optimized two important parameters (gamma in kernel function and penalty parameter) of the LU/LC classification. Using the radial basis function (RBF) of the SVM classification method, we examined seven values for both parameters ranging from 0.001 to 1000. For both climate types, the penalty parameters (PP) showed a direct relationship with overall accuracy (OA). Statistical results confirmed that in humid study regions, LU/LC maps produced with a penalty parameter &gt;100 were more accurate. However, for regions with arid climates, LU/LC maps with a penalty parameter &gt;0.1 were more accurate. Mapping accuracy for both climate types was sensitive to the penalty parameter. In contrast, variations of the gamma values in the kernel function had no effect on the accuracy of the LU/LC maps in either of the climate zones. These new findings on SVM image classification are directly applicable to LU/LC for planning and environmental and natural resource management."

The LST variability was determined using the Landsat Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the land surface emissivity factor. The influence of LULC, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference building index (NDBI), and the normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI) on the variability LST was investigated applying Landsat Satellite data from 1992 to 2020. The pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to compute urban LST and influence of LULC classes. Results revealed that an overall increase of 41.8% in built-up areas at the expense of 24%, 17.4%, and 0.4% decreases in vegetation, bare land, and water from 1992–2020, respectively. Comparison of LST obtained from the meteorological station and satellite images showed a significant coherence. An increase of 4.3 °C in temperature of built-up areas from 1992–2020 was observed.

This uncertainty in bearing applications leads to a worldwide activity in order to understand and prevent this situation since the WEC failure mode deviates from the traditional Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) mode. Plenty of factors have been found to influence this phenomenon over the years, however the precise initiation of the WEC is still under debate. In order to understand the initiation and analyze the temporal evolution, interrupted tests on the same material were performed under conditions that were known to lead to WEC formation and RCF. To avoid the added complexity of boundary lubrication, a Deep Groove Ball Bearing (DGBB) test rig under full lubrication (Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication, EHL) was chosen. Within a standard operating mode, named Mode 1 (RCF), the bearings are solely subjected to a radial load. By suspending the tests at different time steps, a continuous progress of changes in the subsurface material structure seen as equiaxed grains with low dislocation densities, identified as ferrite, is observed. The bearings did not fail up to load cycles of 109.

It became obvious when comparing Mode 1 (RCF) with Mode 2 (ECCF) that Mode 2 (ECCF) achieves far fewer load cycles until failure occurs."

The research for the underlying failure mechanism has attracted interest from a large scientific community over decades. Despite the significant amount of efforts, a root cause of white etching cracking is still missing. Amongst other factors, lubricant chemistry is considered to be essential in WEC formation. The authors aim to elucidate this key parameter by provoking white etching crack formation on a FE8 bearing test rig using a well-described set of chemicals in high- and low-reference lubricants. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis prove the presence of a patchy tribofilm on the surface of bearing washers, leading most likely to a higher frictional torque at the early stages of operation when the low reference oil is used. Secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) shows a hydrogen containing tribofilm in the shallow subsurface of about 30 nm depth, suggesting that hydrogen proliferating into bearing material may subsequently facilitate crack propagation via dislocation pileups, leading to premature bearing failure."

However, recent research has suggested that at low current densities (&lt;1 mA/mm2) under specific operating conditions, electrical discharges can substantially reduce bearing life due to the formation of white etching cracks (WECs). To date, limited studies have investigated the critical operating and electrical conditions for WEC formation and demonstrated effective fault detection techniques. This study uses a novel monitoring technique known as the electrostatic sensing technique to detect, monitor and characterise electrical discharges in an oil-lubricated steel–steel rolling contact on a TE74 twin-roller machine.

As a bionic biomaterial with a clear layered structure, excellent mechanical properties, and interesting rainbow colors, nacre has become one of the most attractive models for novel artificial materials design. In this research paper, the tough and strong nacre-like bio-hybrid membranes with an interpenetrating petals structure were fabricated from chitosan (CS) and magadiite (MAG) clay nanosheets through the gel-casting self-assembling method. The analyses from X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and observations of water droplets on membranes indicated that the nacre-like hybrid membranes had a layered compact structure. Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses suggested that the CS molecular chains formed chemical bonds and hydrogen bonds with MAG layers. The inter-penetrating petal layered structure had a good effect on the mechanical properties of a nacre-like bio-hybrid membranes and the tensile strength of the hybrid membranes could reach at 78.6 MPa. However, the transmission analyses of the results showed that the hybrid membranes still had a certain visible light transmittance. Finally, the hybrid membranes possessed an intriguing efficient fire-shielding property during exposure to the flame of alcohol burner. Consequently, the great biocompatibility and excellent mechanical properties of the bio-hybrid membranes with the special interpenetrating petals structure provides a great opportunity for these composites to be widely applied in biomaterial research."

Naturally, a decrease in price always increases the demand for any smart product. This study introduces a multi-product production process, taking into consideration the advertising- and price-dependent demands of products, where the failure rate of the production system is reduced under the optimum energy consumption. For long-run production systems, unusual energy consumption and machine failures occur frequently, which are reduced in this study. All costs related with the production system are included in the optimum energy costs. The unit production cost is dependent on the production rate of the machine and its failure rate. The aim of this study is to obtain the optimum profit with a reduced failure rate, under the optimum advertising costs and the optimum sale price. The total profit of the model becomes a complex, non-linear function, with respect to the decision variables. For this reason, the model is solved numerically by an iterative method. However, the global optimality is proved numerically, by using the Hessian matrix. The numerical results obtained show that for smart production, the maximum profit always occurs at the optimum values of the decision variables."

This may be used to parameterize the process and to detect defect components early in the production process, among others. The light deflection as the deviation from the linear path of the light is caused by an inhomogeneous refractive index field surrounding the hot object. We present the design and setup for a nozzle-based forced air flow actuator, which suppresses the light deflection effect. The design process includes a simulation of the developing field, as well as of the interaction of the field with an external forced air flow. The cooling effect of the air flow is evaluated, and conclusions are drawn from the conflicting interests of good measurement conditions against the forced cooling of the hot object. The findings are then implemented in the physical setup of the suppression system. The system is evaluated using a previously established method based on optical triangulation and fringe projection.

Though AISI 52100 is generally regarded as non-weldable, it could be applied as a cladding material by adjusting PTA parameters. The cladded parts were investigated after each individual process step and subsequently tested under rolling contact load. Welding defects that could not be completely eliminated by the subsequent hot forming were characterized by means of scanning acoustic microscopy and micrographs. Below the surface, pores with a typical size of ten µm were found to a depth of about 0.45 mm. In the material transition zone and between individual weld seams, larger voids were observed. Grinding of the surface after heat treatment caused compressive residual stresses near the surface with a relatively small depth. Fatigue tests were carried out on an FE8 test rig. Eighty-two percent of the calculated rating life for conventional bearings was achieved. A high failure slope of the Weibull regression was determined.

In this respect, the key information regarding four major types of microstructural alterations, white etching areas/white etching cracks, dark etching regions, white etching bands and light etching regions is reviewed regarding the phenomenology and formation mechanisms. Then, classical and state-of-the-art models are established to predict their formation and are summarised and evaluated.

Rolling bearings are generally not designed to be fatigue-resistant, as the necessary oversizing is not technically and economically marketable. In order to improve the load-bearing capacity, resource efficiency and application possibilities of rolling bearings and other possible multi-material solid components, a new process chain was developed at Leibniz University Hannover as a part of the Collaborative Research Centre 1153 “Tailored Forming”. Semi-finished products, already joined before the forming process, are used here to allow a further optimisation of joint quality by forming and finishing. In this paper, a plasma-powder-deposition welding process is presented, which enables precise material deposition and control of the welding depth. For this study, bearing washers (serving as rolling bearing raceways) of a cylindrical roller thrust bearing, similar to type 81212 with a multi-layer structure, were manufactured. A previously non-weldable high-performance material, steel AISI 5140, was used as the cladding layer. Depending on the degree of forming, grain-refinement within the welded material was achieved by thermo-mechanical treatment of the joining zone during the forming process. This grain-refinements lead to an improvement of the mechanical properties and thus, to a higher lifetime for washers of an axial cylindrical roller bearing, which were examined as an exemplary component on a fatigue test bench. To evaluate the bearing washers, the results of the bearing tests were compared with industrial bearings and deposition welded axial-bearing washers without subsequent forming. In addition, the bearing washers were analysed micro-tribologically and by scanning acoustic microscopy both after welding and after the forming process. Nano-scratch tests were carried out on the bearing washers to analyse the layer properties. Together with the results of additional microscopic images of the surface and cross-sections, the causes of failure due to fatigue and wear were identified."

Presently, MRI imaging of patients with neural implants is highly restricted in high field MRI (e.g., 3 T and higher) due to patient safety concerns. This results in lower resolution MRI images and, consequently, degrades the efficacy of MRI imaging for diagnostic purposes in these patients. Cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) is a biocompatible wide-band-gap semiconductor with a high thermal conductivity and magnetic susceptibility compatible with brain tissue. It also has modifiable electrical conductivity through doping level control. These properties can improve the MRI compliance of 3C-SiC INIs, specifically in high field MRI scanning. In this work, the MRI compliance of epitaxial SiC films grown on various Si wafers, used to implement a monolithic neural implant (all-SiC), was studied. Via finite element method (FEM) and Fourier-based simulations, the specific absorption rate (SAR), induced heating, and image artifacts caused by the portion of the implant within a brain tissue phantom located in a 7 T small animal MRI machine were estimated and measured. The specific goal was to compare implant materials; thus, the effect of leads outside the tissue was not considered. The results of the simulations were validated via phantom experiments in the same 7 T MRI system. The simulation and experimental results revealed that free-standing 3C-SiC films had little to no image artifacts compared to silicon and platinum reference materials inside the MRI at 7 T. In addition, FEM simulations predicted an ~30% SAR reduction for 3C-SiC compared to Pt. These initial simulations and experiments indicate an all-SiC INI may effectively reduce MRI induced heating and image artifacts in high field MRI. In order to evaluate the MRI safety of a closed-loop, fully functional all-SiC INI as per ISO/TS 10974:2018 standard, additional research and development is being conducted and will be reported at a later date."

Although no major outbreak or fatal case in humans has been reported as yet worldwide, a total of 31 acute human cases of Wesselsbron infection have been previously described since its first isolation in 1955. However, most of these cases were reported from Sub-Saharan Africa where resources are limited and a lack of diagnostic means exists.

The validation on clinical and veterinary samples shows that they can be accurately used for Wesselsbron virus detection in public health activities and the veterinary field. Considering the increasing extension of Aedes species worldwide, these new assays could be useful not only in laboratory studies for Wesselsbron virus, but also in routine surveillance activities for zoonotic arboviruses and could be applied in well-equipped central laboratories or in remote areas in Africa, regarding the reverse-transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification assay."

The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or Mpro) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19."

Thus, the relationships among agricultural food production diversity (FPD), dietary diversity (DD), and household food insecurity (HFI) of the rural small holder farmers need further study. Therefore, we examined these associations in small holder farmers residing in this Province in the Andes Highlands (elevation &gt; 2500 m). Non-pregnant maternal home managers (n = 558, x age = 44.1, SD = 16.5 y) were interviewed regarding the number of different agricultural food crops cultivated and domestic animals raised in their family farm plots. DD was determined using the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women Score (MDD-W) based on the number of 10 different food groups consumed, and household food insecurity (HFI) was determined using the 8-item Household Food Insecurity Experience Scale. The women reported consuming an average of 53% of their total food from what they cultivated or raised. Women with higher DD [MMD-W score ≥ 5 food groups (79% of total sample)] were on farms that cultivated a greater variety of crops (x = 8.7 vs. 6.7), raised more animals (x = 17.9 vs. 12.7, p &lt; 0.05), and reported lower HFI and significantly higher intakes of energy, protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin A (all p &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that FPD was only modestly related to DD, which together with years of education, per capita family income, and HFI accounted for 26% of DD variance. In rural areas of the Imbabura Province, small holder farmers still rely heavily on consumption of self-cultivated foods, but greater diversity of crops grown in family farm plots is only weakly associated with greater DD and lower HFI among the female caretakers."

A highly sensitive and flexible sensor is suggested, capable of being attached to the human body, based on a three-dimensional dielectric elastomeric structure of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and microsphere composite. This sensor has maximal porosity due to macropores created by sacrificial layer grains and micropores generated by microspheres pre-mixed with PDMS, allowing it to operate at a wider pressure range (~150 kPa) while maintaining a sensitivity (of 0.124 kPa−1 in a range of 0~15 kPa) better than in previous studies. The maximized pores can cause deformation in the structure, allowing for the detection of small changes in pressure. In addition to exhibiting a fast rise time (~167 ms) and fall time (~117 ms), as well as excellent reproducibility, the fabricated pressure sensor exhibits reliability in its response to repeated mechanical stimuli (2.5 kPa, 1000 cycles).

However, the performance of image classification is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training set and its temporal continuity, which may affect the accuracy of the classification and bias the analysis of the LULC changes. In this study, we intended to apply a long-term LULC analysis in a rural region based on a Landsat time series of 21 years (1995 to 2015). Here, we investigated the use of open LULC source data to provide training samples and the application of the K-means clustering technique to refine the broad range of spectral signatures for each LULC class. Experiments were conducted on a predominantly rural region characterized by a mixed agro-silvo-pastoral environment. The open source data of the official Portuguese LULC map (Carta de Uso e Ocupação do Solo, COS) from 1995, 2007, 2010, and 2015 were integrated to generate the training samples for the entire period of analysis. The time series was computed from Landsat data based on the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index, using 221 Landsat images. The Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) classifier was used, since it accounts for LULC-type seasonality and has already achieved promising overall accuracy values for classifications based on time series. The results revealed that the proposed method was efficient in classifying a long-term satellite time-series with an overall accuracy of 76%, providing insights into the main LULC changes that occurred over 21 years."

Digital soil mapping plays an important role in efficiently obtaining the spatial distribution of SOC, which contributes to precision agriculture. However, traditional soil-forming factors (i.e., terrain or climatic factors) have weak variability in low-relief areas, such as plains, and cannot reflect the spatial variation of soil attributes. Meanwhile, vegetation cover hinders the acquisition of the direct information of farmland soil. Thus, useful environmental variables should be utilized for SOC prediction and the digital mapping of such areas. SOC has an important effect on crop growth status, and remote sensing data can record the apparent spectral characteristics of crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important index reflecting crop growth and biomass. This study used NDVI time series data rather than traditional soil-forming factors to map SOC. Honghu City, located in the middle of the Jianghan Plain, was selected as the study region, and the NDVI time series data extracted from Landsat 8 were used as the auxiliary variables. SOC maps were estimated through stepwise linear regression (SLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). Ordinary kriging (OK) was used as the reference model, while root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and coefficient of determination of prediction (R2P) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results showed that SOC had a significant positive correlation in July and August (0.17, 0.29) and a significant negative correlation in January, April, and December (−0.23, −0.27, and −0.23) with NDVI time series data. The best model for SOC prediction was generated by ANN, with the lowest RMSEP of 3.718 and highest R2P of 0.391, followed by SVM (RMSEP = 3.753, R2P = 0.361) and PLSR (RMSEP = 4.087, R2P = 0.283). The SLR model was the worst model, with the lowest R2P of 0.281 and highest RMSEP of 3.930. ANN and SVM were better than OK (RMSEP = 3.727, R2P = 0.372), whereas PLSR and SLR were worse than OK. Moreover, the prediction results using single-data NDVI or short time series NDVI showed low accuracy. The effect of the terrain factor on SOC prediction represented unsatisfactory results. All these results indicated that the NDVI time series data can be used for SOC mapping in plain areas and that the ANN model can maximally extract additional associated information between NDVI time series data and SOC. This study presented an effective method to overcome the selection of auxiliary variables for digital soil mapping in plain areas when the soil was covered with vegetation. This finding indicated that the time series characteristics of NDVI were conducive for predicting SOC in plains."

Remotely sensed images are commonly used for land cover classification but hardly identifies urban land use and functional areas because of the semantic gap (i.e., different definitions of similar or identical buildings). Social media data, “marks” left by people using mobile phones, have great potential to overcome this semantic gap. Multisource remote sensing data are also expected to be useful in distinguishing different LULC types. This study examined the capability of combined multisource remote sensing images and social media data in urban LULC classification. Multisource remote sensing images included a Chinese ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) high-resolution image, a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral image, and a Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Social media data consisted of the hourly spatial distribution of WeChat users, which is a ubiquitous messaging and payment platform in China. LULC was classified into 10 types, namely, vegetation, bare land, road, water, urban village, greenhouses, residential, commercial, industrial, and educational buildings. A method that integrates object-based image analysis, decision trees, and random forests was used for LULC classification. The overall accuracy and kappa value attained by the combination of multisource remote sensing images and WeChat data were 87.55% and 0.84, respectively. They further improved to 91.55% and 0.89, respectively, by integrating the textural and spatial features extracted from the ZY-3 image. The ZY-3 high-resolution image was essential for urban LULC classification because it is necessary for the accurate delineation of land parcels. The addition of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-1A SAR, or WeChat data also made an irreplaceable contribution to the classification of different LULC types. The Landsat 8 OLI image helped distinguish between the urban village, residential buildings, commercial buildings, and roads, while the Sentinel-1A SAR data reduced the confusion between commercial buildings, greenhouses, and water. Rendering the spatial and temporal dynamics of population density, the WeChat data improved the classification accuracies of an urban village, greenhouses, and commercial buildings."

Multispectral satellite data are readily available and cost-effective sources of spectral data compared to costly and technically demanding processing of hyperspectral data. Moreover, their continuous acquisition allows to develop a composite from time-series, increasing the spatial coverage of SOC maps. In this study, an evaluation of the prediction ability of models assessing SOC using real multispectral remote sensing data from different platforms was performed. The study was conducted on a study plot (1.45 km2) in the Chernozem region of South Moravia (Czechia). The adopted methods included field sampling and predictive modeling using satellite multispectral Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope data, and multispectral UAS Parrot Sequoia data. Furthermore, the performance of a soil reflectance composite image from Sentinel-2 data was analyzed. Aerial hyperspectral CASI 1500 and SASI 600 data was used as a reference. Random forest, support vector machine, and the cubist regression technique were applied in the predictive modeling. The prediction accuracy of models using multispectral data, including Sentinel-2 composite, was lower (RPD range from 1.16 to 1.65; RPIQ range from 1.53 to 2.17) compared to the reference model using hyperspectral data (RPD = 2.26; RPIQ = 3.34). The obtained results show very similar prediction accuracy for all spaceborne sensors (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope). However, the spatial correlation between the reference mapping results obtained from the hyperspectral data and other maps using multispectral data was moderately strong. UAS sensors and freely available satellite multispectral data can represent an alternative cost-effective data source for remote SOC mapping on the local scale."

However, little is known about the SOC content in the contrasting arid and sub-humid regions of Iran, whose complex SOC–landscape relationships pose a challenge to spatial analysis. Machine learning (ML) models with a digital soil mapping framework can solve such complex relationships. Current research focusses on ensemble ML models to increase the accuracy of prediction. The usual ensemble method is boosting or weighted averaging. This study proposes a novel ensemble technique: the stacking of multiple ML models through a meta-learning model. In addition, we tested the ensemble through rescanning the covariate space to maximize the prediction accuracy. We first applied six state-of-the-art ML models (i.e., Cubist, random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), classical artificial neural network models (ANN), neural network ensemble based on model averaging (AvNNet), and deep learning neural networks (DNN)) to predict and map the spatial distribution of SOC content at six soil depth intervals for both regions. In addition, the stacking of multiple ML models through a meta-learning model with/without rescanning the covariate space were tested and applied to maximize the prediction accuracy. Out of six ML models, the DNN resulted in the best modeling accuracies, followed by RF, XGBoost, AvNNet, ANN, and Cubist. Importantly, the stacking of models indicated a significant improvement in the prediction of SOC content, especially when combined with rescanning the covariate space. For instance, the RMSE values for SOC content prediction of the upper 0–5 cm of the soil profiles of the arid site and the sub-humid site by the proposed stacking approaches were 17% and 9% respectively, less than that obtained by the DNN models—the best individual model. This indicates that rescanning the original covariate space by a meta-learning model can extract more information and improve the SOC content prediction accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that the stacking of diverse sets of models could be used to more accurately estimate the spatial distribution of SOC content in different climatic regions."

Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future."

Analysis of variance was employed in order to determine which hyperspectral narrow spectral bands exhibited the most significant differences. Spectral signatures for the range of 400–2500 nm were acquired with Thermo Scientific Evolution 220 and iS50NIR spectrometers. The selected spectral bands were then used to evaluate several RS indices, including ARI (Anthocyanin Reflectance Index), RDVI (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index), MSR (Modified Simple Ratio) and NRI (Nitrogen Reflectance Index), for Fire Blight detection in apple tree leaves. Furthermore, a new index was proposed, namely QFI. The spectral indices were tested on apple trees infected by Fire Blight in a quarantine greenhouse. Results indicated that the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) band located at 1450 nm was able to distinguish (I) and (H) leaves, while the SWIR band at 1900 nm differentiated all three leaf types. Moreover, tests using the Pearson correlation indicated that ARI, MSR and QFI exhibited the highest correlations with the infection progress.

This study incorporated multispectral built-up indices, designed to enhance satellite imagery, for introducing new urban classification schemes. The indices examined are the new built-up index (NBI), the built-up area extraction index (BAEI), and the normalized difference concrete condition index (NDCCI). Landsat Level-2 data covering the city of Miami, FL, USA was leveraged with geographic data from the Florida Geospatial Data Library and Florida Department of Environmental Protection to develop and validate new methods of supervised and unsupervised classification of urban area. NBI was used to extract discrete urban features through object-oriented image analysis. BAEI was found to possess properties for visualizing and tracking urban development as a low-high gradient.

Whether different machine learning methods can improve prediction accuracy in mapping process is less studied in arid areas. Based on that, combined with the proposed problems, this study selected the typical area of the Ebinur Lake Basin in the arid region as the study area, took the sentinel data as the main data source, and used the Sentinel-1A (radar data), the Sentinel-2A and the Sentinel-3A (multispectral data), combined with 16 kinds of DEM derivatives and climate data (annual average temperature MAT, annual average precipitation MAP) as analysis. The five different types of data are reconstructed by spatial data and divided into four spatial resolutions (10, 100, 300, and 500 m). Seven models are constructed and predicted by machine learning methods RF and Cubist. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RF model is better than that of Cubist model, indicating that RF model is more suitable for small areas in arid areas.

However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) &lt; 0.25, (3–5) NDVI &lt; 0.25 and NBR2 &lt; threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 &lt; threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI &lt; 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI &gt; 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 &lt; 0.30, RMSE &gt; 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD &lt; 1.4, n &gt; 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 &lt; 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62%, compared to 95% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied."

First, fractional-order derivative (FOD) processing is performed on the original reflectance (OR) to evaluate the optimal FOD. Second, singular value decomposition (SVD), Fourier transform (FT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are used to denoise the OR and optimal FOD reflectance. Third, the spectral indexes of the reflectance under different denoising methods are extracted by optimal band combination algorithm, and the input variables of different denoising methods are selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. Finally, the SOM content is predicted by a random forest prediction model. The results reveal that 0.6-order reflectance describes more useful details in satellite hyperspectral data. Five spectral indexes extracted from the reflectance under different denoising methods have a strong correlation with the SOM content, which is helpful for realizing high-accuracy SOM predictions. All three denoising methods can reduce the noise in hyperspectral data, and the accuracies of the different denoising methods are ranked DWT &gt; FT &gt; SVD, where 0.6-order-DWT has the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 3.36 g kg−1, and RPIQ = 1.71). This paper is relatively novel, in that GF-5 satellite hyperspectral data based on different denoising methods are used to predict SOM, and the results provide a highly robust and novel method for mapping the spatial distribution of SOM content at the regional scale."

We constructed two comparative experiments, i.e., full-band and common-band variable datasets of Sentinel-2A and MODIS images using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The predictive performances of random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms were evaluated, and the SOM map was generated for the Songnen Plain. Results showed that the model based on the full-band Sentinel-2A dataset achieved the best performance. The application of Sentinel-2A data resulted in mean relative improvements (RIs) of 7.67% and 5.87%, respectively. The RF achieved a lower root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.68%) and a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.67) in all of the predicted scenarios than ANN and SVR. The resultant SOM map accurately characterized the SOM spatial distribution. Therefore, the Sentinel-2A data have obvious advantages over MODIS due to their higher spectral and spatial resolutions, and the combination of the RF algorithm and GEE is an effective approach to SOM mapping."

Urban heat island is are of the most well-known phenomena. In the present study, surface urban heat islands (SUHI) were studied for seven megacities of the South Asian countries from 2000–2019. The urban thermal environment and relationship between land surface temperature (LST), land use landcover (LULC) and vegetation were examined. The connection was explored with remote-sensing indices such as urban thermal field variance (UTFVI), surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and normal difference vegetation index (NDVI). LULC maps are classified using a CART machine learning classifier, and an accuracy table was generated. The LULC change matrix shows that the vegetated areas of all the cities decreased with an increase in the urban areas during the 20 years. The average LST in the rural areas is increasing compared to the urban core, and the difference is in the range of 1–2 (°C). The SUHII linear trend is increasing in Delhi, Karachi, Kathmandu, and Thimphu, while decreasing in Colombo, Dhaka, and Kabul from 2000–2019.

We chose Belgrade, as a case study, to present a cost- and time-effective framework for monitoring spatiotemporal changes of green spaces in relation to the land surface temperature (LST). Time series analysis was performed using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery from 1991 to 2019 with an approximate 5-year interval (18 images in total). Spectral vegetation indices and supervised land cover classifications were used to examine changes of green spaces. The results showed a fluctuating trend of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The highest values were recorded in 2019, indicating vegetation recovery in the last decade. A significant positive correlation was determined between the spectral vegetation indices and the amount of precipitation during growing season. The land cover classification showed that the share of vegetated and bare land decreased by 11.74% during the study period. The most intensive conversion of green and bare land into built-up land cover occurred in the first decade (1991–2000). To assess spatiotemporal changes in the LST, Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature products were used. We found a negative correlation between change in the spectral vegetation indices and change in the LST. This indicates that the reduction in vegetation was associated with an increase in the LST.

Since the Okavango Delta is a transboundary Ramsar site, managing natural resources within the Okavango Basin is undoubtedly a complex issue. It is often difficult to accurately map land use and cover using remote sensing in heterogeneous landscapes. This study investigates the combined value of climate-based regionalization and integration of spectral bands with spectral indices to enhance the accuracy of multi-temporal land use/cover classification using deep learning and machine learning approaches. Two experiments were set up, the first entailing the integration of spectral bands with spectral indices and the second involving the combined integration of spectral indices and climate-based regionalization based on Koppen–Geiger climate zones. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images, machine learning classifiers (random forest and extreme gradient boosting), and deep learning (neural network and deep neural network) classifiers were used in this study. Supervised classification using a total of 5140 samples was conducted for the years 1996, 2004, 2013, and 2020. Average overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were used to validate the results. The study found that the integration of spectral bands with indices improves the accuracy of land use/cover classification using machine learning and deep learning. Post-feature selection combinations yield higher accuracies in comparison to combinations of bands and indices. A combined integration of spectral indices with bands and climate-based regionalization did not significantly improve the accuracy of land use/cover classification consistently for all the classifiers (p &lt; 0.05).

From an environmental monitoring viewpoint, SOC sequestration is essential for mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. SOC dynamics in cropland soils should be further studied through various approaches including remote sensing. In order to predict SOC content over croplands in southwestern France (area of 22,177 km²), this study addresses (i) the influence of the dates on which Sentinel-2 (S2) images were acquired in the springs of 2017–2018 as well as the influence of the soil sampling period of a set of samples collected between 2005 and 2018, (ii) the use of soil moisture products (SMPs) derived from Sentinel-1/2 satellites to analyze the influence of surface soil moisture on model performance when included as a covariate, and (iii) whether the spatial distribution of SOC as mapped using S2 is related to terrain-derived attributes. The influences of S2 image dates and soil sampling periods were analyzed for bare topsoil. The dates of the S2 images with the best performance (RPD ≥ 1.7) were 6 April and 26 May 2017, using soil samples collected between 2016 and 2018. The soil sampling dates were also analyzed using SMP values. Soil moisture values were extracted for each sample and integrated into partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The use of soil moisture as a covariate had no effect on the prediction performance of the models; however, SMP values were used to select the driest dates, effectively mapping topsoil organic carbon. S2 was able to predict high SOC contents in the specific soil types located on the old terraces (mesas) shaped by rivers flowing from the southwestern Pyrénées."

The main findings are summarized as follows. (1) The RF classification algorithm supported by the GEE platform enables fast and accurate acquisition of the LULC dataset, and the overall accuracy is 0.88 ± 0.01. (2) The ecological condition across Xilingol has improved significantly in the last 20 years (2000–2020), and the area of vegetation (grassland and woodland) has increased. Specifically, the area of high-coverage grass and woodland increases (+13.26%, +1.19%), while the area of water and moderate- and low-coverage grass decreases (−15.96%, −7.23%, and −3.27%). Cropland increases first and then decreases (−34.85%) and is mainly distributed in the southeast. The area of deserted land decreases in the south and increases in the center and north, but the total area still decreases (−13.74%). The built-up land expands rapidly (+108.45%). (3) In addition, our results suggest that regional socioeconomic development factors are the primary causes of changes in built-up land, and climate-related factors are the primary causes of water changes, but the correlations between other land-use types and relevant factors are not significant (cropland and grassland). We conclude that the GEE+RF method is capable of automated, long time-series, and high-accuracy land-use mapping, and further changes in climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic development factors, i.e., climate warming and rotational grazing, might have significant implications on regional land surface morphology and landscape dynamics."

Our study comprises three main steps: (1) Labeled Sentinel-2 compliant data are obtained from theoretical spectral reflectance curves, as there are no training data available for the investigated area; (2) Four different classification approaches are used and compared in their ability to identify the defined five snow and ice types, thereof two unsupervised approaches (k-means clustering and rule-based classification via snow and ice indices) and two supervised approaches (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest classifier); (3) We first focus on the pixel-wise classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, and we then use the best-performing approach for a multi-temporal analysis of the Tyndall Glacier area. While the achieved classification results reveal that all of the used classification approaches are suitable for detecting different snow and ice classes on the glacier surface, the multi-temporal analysis clearly reveals the seasonal development of the glacier.

With the increasing availability of satellite data, geospatial analysis tools, and classification methods, it is essential to systematically assess the performance of different combinations of satellite data and classification methods to help select the best approach for LULC classification. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the LULC classification performance of two commonly used platforms (i.e., ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine) with different satellite datasets (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet) through a case study for the city of Charlottetown in Canada. Specifically, three classifiers in ArcGIS Pro, including support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and random forest/random tree (RF/RT), are utilized to develop LULC maps over the period of 2017–2021. Whereas four classifiers in Google Earth Engine, including SVM, RF/RT, minimum distance (MD), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to develop LULC maps for the same period. To identify the most efficient and accurate classifier, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each classifier is calculated throughout the study period for all combinations of satellite data, classification platforms, and methods. Change detection is then conducted using the best classifier to quantify the LULC changes over the study period. Results show that the SVM classifier in both ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine presents the best performance compared to other classifiers. In particular, the SVM in ArcGIS Pro shows an overall accuracy of 89% with Landsat, 91% with Sentinel, and 94% with Planet. Similarly, in Google Earth Engine, the SVM shows an accuracy of 87% with Landsat 8 and 92% with Sentinel 2.

Regression kriging was developed in the study to improve the AGB estimation and mapping using the Landsat 9 image in Wangyedian forest farm, northern China. Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) were used as the original models to predict the AGB trends, and the optimal model was used to overlay the results of kriging interpolation based on the residuals to obtain the new AGB predictions. In addition, Landsat 8 images in Wangyedian were used for comparison and verification with Landsat 9. The results showed that all bands of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 maintained a high degree of uniformity, with positive correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 (p &lt; 0.01). RF achieved the highest estimation accuracy among all the original models based on the two data sources. However, kriging regression can significantly reduce the estimation error, with the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 55.4% and 51.1%, for Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, respectively, compared to the original RF. Further, the R2 and the lowest RMSE for Landsat 8 were 0.88 and 16.83 t/ha, while, for Landsat 9, they were 0.87 and 17.91 t/ha.

The performance of the classification of the first heart sounds is evaluated by using a reference electrocardiogram. Overall, by using the Hilbert transform, the algorithm has a better performance regarding the F1-score and computational effort. The proposed algorithm achieves for the S1 classification an F1-score up to 95.7% and in average 90.5%. The algorithm is robust against the age, BMI, posture, heart rate and auscultation point (except measurements on the back) of the subjects."

This paper proposes a method of rowing sport capture and analysis based on Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). A canoeist’s motion was collected by multiple miniature inertial sensor nodes. The gradient descent method was used to fuse data and obtain the canoeist’s attitude information after sensor calibration, and then the motions of canoeist’s actions were reconstructed.

Machine learning algorithm was used as the classification method to divide the stroke cycle into different phases, including propulsion-phase and recovery-phase, a quantitative kinematic analysis was carried out. Experiments conducted in this paper demonstrated that our method possesses the capacity to reveal the similarities and differences between novice and coach, the whole process of canoeist’s motions can be analyzed with satisfactory accuracy validated by videography method.

The process of recognizing human activities generally involves deploying a set of obtrusive and unobtrusive sensors, pre-processing the raw data, and building classification models using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Integrating data from multiple sensors is a challenging task due to dynamic nature of data sources. This is further complicated due to semantic and syntactic differences in these data sources. These differences become even more complex if the data generated is imperfect, which ultimately has a direct impact on its usefulness in yielding an accurate classifier. In this study, we propose a semantic imputation framework to improve the quality of sensor data using ontology-based semantic similarity learning. This is achieved by identifying semantic correlations among sensor events through SPARQL queries, and by performing a time-series longitudinal imputation. Furthermore, we applied deep learning (DL) based artificial neural network (ANN) on public datasets to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed approach. The results showed a higher accuracy with semantically imputed datasets using ANN. We also presented a detailed comparative analysis, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art from the literature. We found that our semantic imputed datasets improved the classification accuracy with 95.78% as a higher one thus proving the effectiveness and robustness of learned models."

The resulting electrochemical biosensor was validated towards glucose oxidation in real samples and further electrochemical measurement associated with the generated H2O2. The electrochemical biosensor showed an excellent sensitivity (42.7 μA mM−1 cm−2), limit of detection (7.6 μM), linear range (20 μM–2.3 mM), and good selectivity towards glucose determination. Furthermore, and most importantly, the detection of glucose was performed at a low potential (0.2 V vs. Ag). The high performance of the electrochemical biosensor was explained through surface exploration using field emission SEM, XPS, and impedance measurements. The electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to glucose quantification in several real samples (commercial juices and a plant cell culture medium), exhibiting a high accuracy when compared with a classical spectrophotometric method. This electrochemical biosensor can be easily prepared and opens up a good alternative in the development of new sensitive glucose sensors."

This can be used to improve the quality of life of patients and medical staff in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environment. However, in the IoMT cloud environment, there are various security threats to the patient’s medical data. As a result, security features such as encryption of collected data and access control by legitimate users are essential. Many studies have been conducted on access control techniques using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), a form of attribute-based encryption, among various security technologies and studies are underway to apply them to the medical field. However, several problems persist. First, as the secret key does not identify the user, the user may maliciously distribute the secret key and such users cannot be tracked. Second, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) increases the size of the ciphertext depending on the number of attributes specified. This wastes cloud storage, and computational times are high when users decrypt. Such users must employ outsourcing servers. Third, a verification process is needed to prove that the results computed on the outsourcing server are properly computed. This paper focuses on the IoMT environment for a study of a CP-ABE-based medical data sharing system with key abuse prevention and verifiable outsourcing in a cloud environment. The proposed scheme can protect the privacy of user data stored in a cloud environment in the IoMT field, and if there is a problem with the secret key delegated by the user, it can trace a user who first delegated the key. This can prevent the key abuse problem. In addition, this scheme reduces the user’s burden when decoding ciphertext and calculates accurate results through a server that supports constant-sized ciphertext output and verifiable outsourcing technology. The goal of this paper is to propose a system that enables patients and medical staff to share medical data safely and efficiently in an IoMT environment."

While the contact-less method enables the measurement of such an object, the results are influenced by the light deflection effect occurring due to the inhomogeneous refractive index field induced by the hot air around the measurand. However, the developed active compensation methods to fight this issue exhibits a major drawback, namely an additional cooling of the object and a subsequent transient illumination component. In this paper, we investigate the cooling and its effect on temporal phase reconstruction algorithms and take a theoretical approach to its compensation. The simulated compensation measures are transferred to a fringe projection profilometry setup and are evaluated using established and newly developed methods. The results show a significant improvement when measuring specimens under a transient illumination and are easily transferable to any kind of multi-frequency phase-shift measurement."

One of its major complications is diabetic foot, leading to plantar ulcers, amputation, and death. Several studies report that a thermogram helps to detect changes in the plantar temperature of the foot, which may lead to a higher risk of ulceration. However, in diabetic patients, the distribution of plantar temperature does not follow a standard pattern, thereby making it difficult to quantify the changes. The abnormal temperature distribution in infrared (IR) foot thermogram images can be used for the early detection of diabetic foot before ulceration to avoid complications. There is no machine learning-based technique reported in the literature to classify these thermograms based on the severity of diabetic foot complications. This paper uses an available labeled diabetic thermogram dataset and uses the k-mean clustering technique to cluster the severity risk of diabetic foot ulcers using an unsupervised approach. Using the plantar foot temperature, the new clustered dataset is verified by expert medical doctors in terms of risk for the development of foot ulcers. The newly labeled dataset is then investigated in terms of robustness to be classified by any machine learning network. Classical machine learning algorithms with feature engineering and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with image-enhancement techniques are investigated to provide the best-performing network in classifying thermograms based on severity. It is found that the popular VGG 19 CNN model shows an accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity of 95.08%, 95.08%, 95.09%, 95.08%, and 97.2%, respectively, in the stratification of severity. A stacking classifier is proposed using extracted features of the thermogram, which is created using the trained gradient boost classifier, XGBoost classifier, and random forest classifier. This provides a comparable performance of 94.47%, 94.45%, 94.47%, 94.43%, and 93.25% for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity, respectively."

Healthy diet education plays an important role in the promotion of people’s healthy behavior. However, in the modern age, the data regarding healthy diets available on the internet is increasing rapidly and is distributed on multiple sources. It is time-consuming for users to learn about healthy diets on the internet: they need to search data on multiple platforms, choose and integrate information, and then understand what they have learned. To help people retrieve and learn healthy diet knowledge more efficiently and comprehensively, this paper designs a knowledge graph to integrate healthy diet information on the internet and provides a semantic retrieval system. In the knowledge graph, five main concepts are defined, including food material, dish, nutritional element, symptom, and crowd, as well as the relationships among them. In addition, Chinese dietary culture elements and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory are also contained in the knowledge graph. The preliminary results show that by using the system, users learn healthy diet knowledge more quickly and comprehensively and they are more inclined to have balanced diets. This work could be regarded as a retrieval and education tool, which can assist healthcare and national sustainable development."

This LULC change increased the land surface temperature (LST) in the region. LULC and LST changes were assessed for the period of 1990–2017 using Landsat data and the support vector machine (SVM) method. A combined cellular automata and artificial neural network (CA-ANN) prediction model was used for simulation of LULC changes for the period of 2032 and 2047 using transition potential matrix obtained from the data years of 2002 and 2017. The accuracy of the CA-ANN model was validated using simulated and classified images of 2017 with correctness value of 70% using validation modules in QGIS. The thermal bands of Landsat images from the years 1990, 2002 and 2017 were used for LST derivation. LST acquired for this period was then modeled for 2032 and 2047 using urban indices (UI) and linear regression analysis. The SVM land cover classification results showed a 5.75% and 4.22% increase in built-up area and bare soil respectively, while vegetation declined by 9.88% during 1990–2017. The results of LST for LULC classes showed that the built-up area had the highest mean LST as compared to other classes. The future projection of LULC and LST showed that the built-up area may increase by 12.48% and 14.65% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total LULC area which was ~11% in 2017. Similarly, the area with temperature above 30 °C could be 44.01% and 58.02% in 2032 and 2047, respectively, of the total study area which was 18.64% in 2017. This study identified major challenges for urban planners to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon.

In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the “Morgenstadt Werkstatt” (Tomorrow’s Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins.

Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved.

At present, the applications of digital twins in the construction industry have gained significant momentum and the industry has gradually entered the information age.

However, traditional “dictionary-based” or “supervised” knowledge graph building methods rely on predefined human-annotated resources of entities and their relationships. The cost of creating human-annotated resources is high in terms of both time and effort. This means that relying on human-annotated resources will not allow rapid adaptability in describing new knowledge when domain-specific information is added or updated very frequently, such as with the recent coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic situation. Therefore, in this study, we propose an Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) system based on unsupervised learning without a pre-built dataset. The proposed method obtains knowledge from a vast amount of text documents about COVID-19 rather than a general knowledge base and add this to the existing knowledge graph. First, we constructed a COVID-19 entity dictionary, and then we scraped a large text dataset related to COVID-19. Next, we constructed a COVID-19 perspective language model by fine-tuning the bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) pre-trained language model. Finally, we defined a new COVID-19-specific knowledge base by extracting connecting words between COVID-19 entities using the BERT self-attention weight from COVID-19 sentences.

The results indicate that the GDP had a strong positive correlation with built-up area (R2 = 0.98). However, there is a strong negative correlation between the GDP and vegetation area (R2 = 0.97) in Guangzhou City, China. As a consequence, the increase of built-up area was at the cost of the reduction of vegetation area."

The population is the manufacturer domiciled in East Java, Indonesia, which has implemented ERP and been certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the environmental management system. Data collection used a questionnaire designed with the five-point Likert scale. Of 243 manufacturers, 150 questionnaires were distributed, and 135 questionnaires are considered valid for analysis. Data analysis used smart PLS software. The result indicated that all eight predetermined hypotheses were supported. Enhanced ERP affects supplier integration, internal integration, and green supply chain management. Internal integration affects green supply chain management and firm performance. Supplier integration affects green supply chain management and firm performance. Green supply chain management affects firm performance. An interesting finding is that green supply chain management, internal integration, and supplier integration mediate the effect of enhanced ERP on firm performance. This study’s novelty lies in the research model that analyzes the relationship between the four constructs simultaneously with the green supply chain management, internal integration, and supplier integration as a mediating variable. The research provides an insight for the manager on how to improve the firm performance in supply chain management.

Monitoring and assessing LULC change over large areas is critical in a variety of fields, including natural resource management and climate change research. LULC change has emerged as a critical concern for policymakers and environmentalists. As the need for the reliable estimation of LULC maps from remote sensing data grows, it is critical to comprehend how different machine learning classifiers perform. The primary goal of the present study was to classify LULC on the Google Earth Engine platform using three different machine learning algorithms—namely, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART)—and to compare their performance using accuracy assessments. The LULC of the study area was classified via supervised classification. For improved classification accuracy, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NDWI (normalized difference water index) indices were also derived and included. For the years 2016, 2018, and 2020, multitemporal Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data with spatial resolutions of 10 m and 30 m were used for the LULC classification. ‘Water bodies’, ‘forest’, ‘barren land’, ‘vegetation’, and ‘built-up’ were the major land use classes. The average overall accuracy of SVM, RF, and CART classifiers for Landsat-8 images was 90.88%, 94.85%, and 82.88%, respectively, and 93.8%, 95.8%, and 86.4% for Sentinel-2 images. These results indicate that RF classifiers outperform both SVM and CART classifiers in terms of accuracy."

More specifically, the effects of COVID-19 on road safety are still largely unexplored. Hence, this study aims to investigate the change in road safety trends due to COVID-19 using real-time traffic parameters. Results from the extensive analyses of the 2017 to 2020 data of Interstate-4 show that traffic volume decreased by 13.6% in 2020 compared to the average of 2017–2019’s volume, whereas there is a decreasing number of crashes at the higher volume. Average speed increased by 11.3% during the COVID-19 period; however, the increase in average speed during the COVID-19 period has an insignificant relationship with crash severities. Fatal crashes increased, while total crashes decreased, during the COVID-19 period; severe crashes decreased with the total crashes. Alcohol-related crashes decreased by 22% from 2019 to 2020. Thus, the road-safety trend due to the impact of COVID-19 has evidently changed and presents a unique trend. The findings of the study suggest a larger need for a more in-depth study to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on road safety, to minimize fatalities on roads through appropriate policy measures."

However, there have not been many studies that have compared and evaluated the performance of maximum likelihood (ML), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART) using ASTER imagery, especially in a mining district. Therefore, this study aims to investigate land use/cover (LULC) change over three decades (1990–2020), comparing the performance of the ML, RF, SVM, and CART machine learning algorithms. The Landsat and ASTER data were retrieved using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Traditional ML classification was performed on ArcGIS 10.2 software while RF, SVM, and CART classification were undertaken on GEE. Then, thematic accuracy assessments were conducted for the four algorithms and their performances were compared. The results showed that the largest changes in area occurred in forest cover that decreased from 37.8 to 27.3 km2 during the three decades. The remarkable expansion of gold mining occurred during 2005–2010 with the increases of 1.6%. The mining land rose by 2.9% during the study period whereas agricultural land increased significantly by 10.7% between 1990 and 2020. When comparing the four algorithms, the RF algorithm gives the highest accuracy with an overall accuracy of 95.85% while SVM follows RF with 91.69%.

With 208 teachers surveyed from 52 Australian urban and rural primary schools, we found that culture sharing had positive contributions to Indigenous students’ engaged learning, whereas integrative teaching and community linking positively predicted teachers’ self-concept in Indigenous teaching. These differential patterns suggest useful strategies for enhancing student- or teacher-focused outcomes, respectively. How to successfully integrate these Indigenous teaching strategies is a key to successful teaching practice, as these strategies cannot only improve Indigenous students’ engaged learning but, at the same time, may foster teachers’ confidence in teaching Indigenous students."

The higher radiation resolution improves the sensitivity of the sensor to detect many subtler differences, especially in the case of dense forests or water. However, it remains unclear whether the difference in radiation resolution between Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 actually affects the classification results of water and tree species. Accordingly, the spectral reflectance and vegetation indices were extracted in this study, based on Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 images. Then, the classification models of land use and land cover (LULC) and tree species were developed by using a gradient tree boosting algorithm. Subsequently, the results were analyzed to further investigate how the differences in radiation resolution affect the classification results of LULC and tree species. It is shown that the LULC classification results of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 are relatively favorable in most cases. However, the LULC classification results are relatively poor in test areas with a lower classification accuracy of water. Further analysis, in the case of test areas with poor classification results, indicates that there are significant differences in the water classification results between the two datasets. In other words, Landsat 9 produces better water classification results than Landsat 8 in most test areas. However, a temperature close to zero may lead to inverse water classification results. In addition, it indicates that the difference in forest classification results between the two datasets is small, but the results of forest tree species classification based on Landsat 9 are superior to those based on Landsat 8, with an improvement in overall accuracy of 6.01%. The results demonstrate that the difference in radiation resolution between Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 has little impact on the results of LULC classification in most cases. Nevertheless, in the case of some test areas, Landsat 9 is better suited for enhancing the classification accuracy of water and tree species."

This LST variation is mainly affected by the spatiotemporal changes of land cover classes, their geospatial characteristics, and spectral indices. Melbourne has been the subject of previous studies of land cover change but often over short time periods without considering the trade-offs between land use/land cover (LULC) and mean daytimes summer season LST over a more extended period. To fill this gap, this research aims to investigate the role of LULC change on mean annual daytime LST in the hot summers of 2001 and 2018 in Melbourne. To achieve the study’s aim, LULC and LST maps were generated based on the cost-effective cloud-based geospatial analysis platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). Furthermore, the geospatial and geo-statistical relationship between LULC, LST, and spectral indices of LULC, including the Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were identified. The findings showed that the mean daytime LST increased by 5.1 °C from 2001 to 2018. The minimum and maximum LST values were recorded for the vegetation and the built-up area classes for 2001 and 2018. Additionally, the mean daytime LST for vegetation and the built-up area classes increased by 5.5 °C and 5.9 °C from 2001 to 2018, respectively. Furthermore, both elevation and NDVI were revealed as the most influencing factors in the LULC classification process. Considering the R2 values between LULC and LST and their NDVI values in 2018, grass (0.48), forest (0.27), and shrubs (0.21) had the highest values. In addition, urban areas (0.64), bare land (0.62), and cropland (0.61) LULC types showed the highest R2 values between LST regarding their NDBI values. This study highlights why urban planners and policymakers must understand the impacts of LULC change on LST.

The present study was conducted to identify indicators to develop indices for assessment of sustainability in some populated cities of Punjab. The study focused on the indicators based on environmental, economic and social development to develop a rational indicator system on the basis of secondary data collected from 2004 to 2014. A total of 40 indicators were identified to assess the urban sustainability progress in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujranwala and Faisalabad cities. The result of the sub-indices indicated that poor performance was evident in the environmental sector, rather than in the economic and social sectors. The cities scored between 0.27 and 0.58 in environmental dimensions, showing a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014. The declining trend of indices was due to population influx, rapid urbanization, reduction in green areas, industrialization, high level of atmospheric and water pollutants. In case of the economic sector, an increasing trend was observed which indicates the gradual improvement in living standards of people. In the social dimensions of the indicator system, less variations were observed among the cities and ranged between 0.49 and 0.58. Overall, the results of the urban sustainability index showed score was ranges between 0.41 to 0.52.

In this paper, a supervised learning-based method, using a multi-layer perceptron neural network and carefully selected vector of features, is proposed. In particular, for each pixel of a retinal fundus image, we construct a 24-D feature vector, encoding information on the local intensity, morphology transformation, principal moments of phase congruency, Hessian, and difference of Gaussian values. A post-processing technique depending on mathematical morphological operators is used to optimise the segmentation. Moreover, the selected feature vector succeeded in outfitting the symmetric features that provided the final blood vessel probability as a binary map image. The proposed method is tested on three known datasets: Digital Retinal Image for Extraction (DRIVE), Structure Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and CHASED_DB1 datasets. The experimental results, both visual and quantitative, testify to the robustness of the proposed method. This proposed method achieved 0.9607, 0.7542, and 0.9843 in DRIVE, 0.9632, 0.7806, and 0.9825 on STARE, 0.9577, 0.7585 and 0.9846 in CHASE_DB1, with respectable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity performance metrics.

However, one of the prominent problems of multilabel classification is missing labels (incomplete labels) in multilabel text. The multilabel classification performance is reduced significantly with the presence of missing labels. In order to address the incomplete or missing label problem, this study proposes two methods: an aggregated feature and label graph-based missing label handling method (GB-AS), and a unified graph-based missing label propagation method (UG-MLP). GB-AS is used to obtain an initial label matrix based on the similarity of both document levels: feature-based weighting representation and label-based weighting representation. On the other hand, UG-MLP is introduced to construct a mixed graph that combines GB-AS and label correlations into a single groundwork. A high-order label correlation is learned from the incomplete training data and applied to supplement the missing label matrix, which guides the creation of multilabel classification models. The combination of the mixed graphs by UG-MLP is aimed to obtain the benefits of both graphs to increase the classification performance. To evaluate UG-MLP, the metrics of precision, recall and F-measure were used on three benchmark datasets, namely, the Reuters-21578, Bibtex and Enron datasets. The experimental results show that UG-MLP outperformed GB-AS as well as other state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, we can infer from the findings that by plotting a unified graph based on joining aggregated feature and label weightings together with the label correlation, the performance of multilabel classification can be improved."

Neural networks (NN) and machine-learning (ML) approaches are increasingly used to solve real-world problems, overcoming analytical and statistical methods, due to their ability to deal with dynamic behavior over time and with a large number of parameters in massive data. In this paper, machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) algorithms are proposed for predicting traffic flow at an intersection, thus laying the groundwork for adaptive traffic control, either by remote control of traffic lights or by applying an algorithm that adjusts the timing according to the predicted flow. Therefore, this work only focuses on traffic flow prediction. Two public datasets are used to train, validate and test the proposed ML and DL models. The first one contains the number of vehicles sampled every five minutes at six intersections for 56 days using different sensors. For this research, four of the six intersections are used to train the ML and DL models. The Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) obtained better results (R-Squared and EV score of 0.93) and took less training time, followed closely by Gradient Boosting then Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), with good metrics results but the longer training time, and finally Random Forest, Linear Regression and Stochastic Gradient.

In the recent past, much literature has demonstrated machine learning approaches as an opportunity to efficiently diagnose heart disease patients. However, challenges associated with datasets such as missing data, inconsistent data, and mixed data (containing inconsistent missing data both as numerical and categorical) are often obstacles in medical diagnosis. This inconsistency led to a higher probability of misprediction and a misled result. Data preprocessing steps like feature reduction, data conversion, and data scaling are employed to form a standard dataset—such measures play a crucial role in reducing inaccuracy in final prediction. This paper aims to evaluate eleven machine learning (ML) algorithms—Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), AdaBoost (AB), Extra Tree Classifier (ET)—and six different data scaling methods—Normalization (NR), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA), Robust Scaler (RS), and Quantile Transformer (QT) on a dataset comprising of information of patients with heart disease. The result shows that CART, along with RS or QT, outperforms all other ML algorithms with 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 99% recall, and 100% F1 score.

Nanobodies (Nbs) are camelid heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments. We generated two oligomeric Nbs by linking two or three monomeric Nbs (Mono-Nbs) targeting the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared their RBD-binding affinity, RBD–receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Relative to Mono-Nb, dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) had significantly greater ability to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without mutations in the RBD, thereby potently blocking RBD–MERS-CoV receptor binding. The engineered oligomeric Nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. Importantly, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel MERS-CoV strains isolated in different countries and years.

Vaccine design traditionally relies on the viral surface glycoproteins. However, surface glycoproteins rarely elicit effective long-term immunity due to high variability. Therefore, an alternative approach is to include conserved structural proteins such as nucleoprotein (NP). NP is engaged in myriad processes in the viral life cycle: coating and protection of viral RNA, regulation of transcription/replication processes and induction of immunosuppression of the host. A broad heterosubtypic T-cellular protection was ascribed very early to this protein. In contrast, the understanding of the humoral immunity to NP is very limited in spite of the high titer of non-neutralizing NP-specific antibodies raised upon natural infection or immunization. In this review, the data with important implications for the understanding of the role of NP in the immune response to human NSVs are revisited. Major implications of the elicited T-cell immune responses to NP are evaluated, and the possible multiple mechanisms of the neglected humoral response to NP are discussed.

Between December 2018 and November 2019, samples were collected at approximately monthly intervals in roosting and feeding sites from 820 bats from an Eidolon helvum colony. Dried blood spots (DBS) were tested for antibodies to Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses. The proportion of samples reactive with GP antigens increased significantly with age from 0–9/220 (0–4.1%) in juveniles to 26–158/225 (11.6–70.2%) in immature adults and 10–225/372 (2.7–60.5%) in adult bats. Antibody responses were lower in lactating females. Viral RNA was not detected in 456 swab samples collected from 152 juvenile and 214 immature adult bats. Overall, our study shows that antibody levels increase in young bats suggesting that seroconversion to Ebola or related viruses occurs in older juvenile and immature adult bats. Multiple year monitoring would be needed to confirm this trend. Knowledge of the periods of the year with the highest risk of Ebolavirus circulation can guide the implementation of strategies to mitigate spill-over events."

VLPs are generally produced using the insect cell/baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), or in mammalian cells by plasmid DNA transient gene expression (TGE). However, VLPs produced with the insect cell/BEVS are difficult to purify and might not display the appropriate post-translational modifications, whereas plasmid DNA TGE approaches are expensive and have a limited scale-up capability. In this study, the production of Gag VLPs with the BacMam expression system in a suspension culture of HEK293 cells is addressed. The optimal conditions of multiplicity of infection (MOI), viable cell density (VCD) at infection, and butyric acid (BA) concentration that maximize cell transduction and VLP production are determined. In these conditions, a maximum cell transduction efficiency of 91.5 ± 1.1%, and a VLP titer of 2.8 ± 0.1 × 109 VLPs/mL are achieved. Successful VLP generation in transduced HEK293 cells is validated using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, with VLPs produced resembling immature HIV-1 virions and with an average size comprised in the 100–200 nm range. Additionally, evidence that BacMam transduction occurs via different pathways including dynamin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis is provided. This work puts the basis for future studies aiming at scaling up the BacMam baculovirus system as an alternative strategy for VLP production."

Recently, the first solitary cases were reported after COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of the present study was to assess if an increased frequency of OLL/OLP can be found after COVID-19 vaccination within a large real-world cohort. It was assumed that the incidence of OLL/OLP was significantly higher in subjects who received COVID-19 vaccine (cohort I) compared to individuals who were not vaccinated (cohort II). Patients and Methods: Initial cohorts of 274,481 vaccinated and 9,429,892 not vaccinated patients were retrieved from the TriNetX database (TriNetX, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), and matched for age, gender and the frequency of use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Results: After matching each cohort, we accounted for 217,863 patients. Among cohort I, 146 individuals had developed OLL/OLP within 6 days after COVID-19 vaccination (88 and 58 subjects had received mRNA- and adenovirus vector-based vaccines), whereas in cohort II, 59 patients were newly diagnosed with OLL/OLP within 6 days after having visited the clinic for any other reason. The risk of developing OLL/OLP was calculated as 0.067% vs. 0.027%, for cohorts I and II, whereby the risk difference was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001; log-rank test). RR and OR were 2.475 (95% CI = 1.829; 3.348) and 2.476 (95% CI = 1.830; 3.350), respectively. Discussion: The hypothesis was confirmed. Accordingly, the obtained results suggest that the onset of OLL/OLP is a rare adverse drug reaction to COVID-19 vaccines, especially to mRNA vaccines. Thus far, it remains unknown if specific components of the formulations cause a type IV hypersensitive reaction corresponding to OLL, or if the immune response post vaccination triggers a T cell-driven autoimmune reaction directed against the basal layer of keratinocytes of the oral mucosa in terms of OLP. Although OLL and OLP are both classified as premalignant lesions, spontaneous remission may be expected over time, at least in the case of OLL. Therefore, the presented findings should not place any limitation toward the use of COVID-19-vaccines in broad levels of the population."

In nutrient‐limited systems, plant competitive ability is expected to be closely tied to the ability of a plant to exploit nutrient‐rich microsites and use these captured nutrients efficiently. The broad objective of this work was to compare the ability of native and invasive perennial forbs to acquire and use nutrients from nutrient‐rich microsites. We evaluated morphological and physiological responses among four native and four invasive species exposed to heterogeneous (patch) or homogeneous (control) nutrient distribution. Invasives, on average, allocated more biomass to roots and allocated proportionately more root length to nutrient‐rich microsites than did natives. Invasives also had higher leaf N, photosynthetic rates, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency than natives, regardless of treatment. While these results suggest multiple traits may contribute to the success of invasive forbs in low‐nutrient environments, we also observed large variation in these traits among native forbs. These observations support the idea that functional trait variation in the plant community may be a better predictor of invasion resistance than the functional group composition of the plant community."

Progeny grown from seeds produced under different watering treatments showed no maternal effects in seed mass, germination, biomass or SLA. High phenotypic plasticity, rather than local adaptation is likely responsible for variation in invasiveness.

               Future microcalorimeter X-ray observations will resolve spectral features in unmatched detail. Understanding of line formation processes in X-rays deserves much attention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss such processes in the presence of a photoionizing source. Line formation processes in one- and two-electron species are broadly categorized into four cases. Case A occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are very small and photoexcitation does not occur. Line photons escape the cloud without any scattering. Case B occurs when the Lyman line optical depths are large enough for photons to undergo multiple scatterings. Case C occurs when a broadband continuum source strikes an optically thin cloud. The Lyman lines are enhanced by induced radiative excitation of the atoms/ions by continuum photons, also known as continuum pumping. A fourth, less studied scenario, where the Case B spectrum is enhanced by continuum pumping, is called Case D. Here, we establish the mathematical foundation of Cases A, B, C, and D in an irradiated cloud with Cloudy. We also show the total X-ray emission spectrum for all four cases within the energy range 0.1–10 keV at the resolving power of XRISM around 6 keV. Additionally, we show that the combined effect of electron scattering and partial blockage of continuum pumping reduces the resonance line intensities. Such reduction increases with column density and can serve as an important tool to measure the column density/optical depth of the cloud."

Our discovery of the axial merger shock front unveils a critical epoch in the formation of a massive galaxy cluster, when two subclusters are caught in the early phase of the merging process. We find that the electron temperature in the postshock region favors the instant collisionless model, where electrons are strongly heated at the shock front, by interactions with the magnetic field. We also report on the detection of an intercluster gas filament, with a temperature of <jats:italic>kT</jats:italic> = 1.07 ± 0.29 keV, along the merger axis of Abell 98. The measured properties of the gas in the filament are consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations of the hottest, densest parts of the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), where WHIM filaments interface with the virialization regions of galaxy clusters."

Science needs new navigation tools so that researchers within and outside of a research field as well as science journalists, students, teachers, practitioners, policy-makers, and others interested in the field can more easily understand its key ideas. Such navigation tools could, for example, be maps of the major concepts and hypotheses of a research field. Applying a bibliometric method, we created such maps for invasion biology. We analysed research papers of the last two decades citing at least two of 35 common invasion hypotheses. Co-citation analysis yields four distinct clusters of hypotheses.

Understanding instance-level data might be easier for users because of their higher concreteness, but instances will often be orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning. As such, the visualization of instance-level data poses different but real challenges. The authors present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them. This visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties.

Their manual creation is problematic due to (1) the high specificity, resulting in a large number of concepts, and (2) the need for timely ontology maintenance due to product innovation; and due to cost, since building such ontologies from scratch requires significant resources. At the same time, industrial categorization standards, like UNSPSC, eCl@ss, eOTD, or the RosettaNet Technical Dictionary, reflect some degree of consensus and contain a wealth of concept definitions plus a hierarchy. They can thus be valuable input for creating domain ontologies. However, the transformation of existing standards, originally developed for some purpose other than ontology engineering, into useful ontologies is not as straightforward as it appears. In this paper, (1) we argue that deriving products and services ontologies from industrial taxonomies is more feasible than manual ontology engineering; (2) show that the representation of the original semantics of the input standard, especially the taxonomic relationship, is an important modeling decision that determines the usefulness of the resulting ontology; (3) illustrate the problem by analyzing existing ontologies derived from UNSPCS and eCl@ss; (4) present a methodology for creating ontologies in OWL based on the reuse of existing standards; and (5) demonstrate this approach by transforming eCl@ss 5.1 into a practically useful products and services ontology.</p>"

The system demands re-entry of the data at data processing and analysis points, thus making it prone to introduction of errors during this process. All these challenges contribute to delayed acquisition, processing and response to disease events occurring in remote hard to reach areas. Our study piloted the use of mobile phones in order to transmit near to real-time data from remote districts in Tanzania (Ngorongoro and Ngara), Burundi (Muyinga) and Zambia (Kazungula and Sesheke). Two technologies namely, digital and short messaging services were used to capture and transmit disease event data in the animal and human health sectors in the study areas based on a server–client model. Smart phones running the Android operating system (minimum required version: Android 1.6), and which supported open source application, Epicollect, as well as the Open Data Kit application, were used in the study. These phones allowed collection of geo-tagged data, with the opportunity of including static and moving images related to disease events. The project supported routine disease surveillance systems in the ministries responsible for animal and human health in Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia, as well as data collection for researchers at the Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania. During the project implementation period between 2011 and 2013, a total number of 1651 diseases event-related forms were submitted, which allowed reporters to include GPS coordinates and photographs related to the events captured. It was concluded that the new technology-based surveillance system is useful in providing near to real-time data, with potential for enhancing timely response in rural remote areas of Africa.

The aim was to obtain a mix ratio that would optimise selected physical properties of the bread. Wheat flour was substituted with Cassava and African Yam Bean flours at different levels: 80% to 100% of wheat, 0% to 10% of cassava flour and 0% to 10% for AYB flour. The experiment was conducted in mixture design which was generated and analysed by Design-Expert Software 11 version. The Composite dough was prepared in different mix ratios according to the design matrix and subsequentlybaked under the same conditions and analysed for the following loaf quality attributes: Loaf Specific Volume, Bread Crumb Hardness and Crumb Colour Index as response variables. The objective functions were to maximize Loaf Specific Volume, minimize Wheat flour, Bread Crumb Hardness and Crumb Colour Index to obtain the most suitable substitution ratio acceptable to  consumers. Predictive models for the response variables were developed with the coefficient of determination (R2 ) of 0.991 for Loaf Specific Volume (LSV) while that of Bread Crumb Hardness (BCH) and Crumb Colour Index (CCI) were 0.834 and 0.895 respectively at 95% confidence interval (CI).The predicted optimal substitution ratio was obtained as follows: 88% Wheat flour, 10% Cassava flour, and 2% AYB flour. At this formulation, the predicted Loaf Specific Volume was 2.11cm3 /g, Bread Crumb Hardness was 25.12N, and Crumb Colour Index was 18.88.The study shows that addition of 2% of AYB flour in the formulation would help to optimise the LSV, BCH and the CCI of the Wheat-Cassava flour bread at the mix ratio of 88:10. Application of the results of this study in bread industries will reduce the cost of bread in Nigeria, which is influenced by the rising cost of imported wheat. This is a significant development because wheat flour was the sole baking flour in Nigeria before wheat substitution initiative.&#x0D;

Computer aided systems have also been well researched through the use intelligent algorithms capable of detecting, diagnosing, and proffering treatment for breast cancer.  While good research breakthrough has been attained in terms of algorithmic solution towards diagnosis of breast cancer, however, not much has been done to sufficiently model knowledge frameworks for diagnostic algorithms that are knowledge-based. While Select and Test (ST) algorithm have proven relevant for implementing diagnostic systems, through support for reasoning, however the knowledge representation pattern that enables inference of missing or ambiguous data still limits the effectiveness of ST algorithm. This paper therefore proposes a knowledge representation model to systematically model knowledge to aid the performance of ST algorithm. Our proposal is specifically targeted at developing systematic knowledge representation for breast cancer. The approach uses the ontology web language (OWL) to implement the design of the knowledge model proposed.   This study aims at carefully crafting a knowledge model whose implementation seamlessly work with ST algorithm. Furthermore, this study adapted the proposed model into an implementation of ST algorithm an obtained an improved performance compared to the simple knowledge model proposed by the author of ST algorithm. Our knowledge mode resulted in an accuracy gain of 23.5% and obtained and AUC of (0.49, 1.0). This proposed model has therefore shown that combining an inference-oriented knowledge model with an inference-oriented reasoning algorithm improves the performance of computer aided diagnostic (CADx) systems.

Social distancing and other protocols required during the COVID-19 pandemic have been particularly difficult for students who are disabled, especially hearing impairments students. During the Covid-19, many disabled students were impacted physically, mentally and their interactions may have been hindered. That could be one of the barriers for full and active participation in society during the Covid- 19. Therefore, this study aims to discover the challenges faced by hearing impairment students how it affects the communication and mainstreaming process. The data was collected from ten hearing impairments students and analysed qualitatively. The participants were aged between 19-22 and currently studying foundation programme in culinary arts in a skill transformation center. The participants were interviewed using impromptu interview questions via WhatsApp, which lasted about ten minutes for each participant. The findings show that there were four challenges faced by the hearing impairment students; hearing devices, disruption to comprehend the lesson, not familiar with the online devices and emotionally affected during online classes. The findings further reveal that the hearing impairment students hampered their social interactions skills towards others during the pandemic. It is hoped the findings would be useful for academicians, counsellors, doctors and other job professions to explore further research on hearing impairments and the framing of methodology to assist the hearing impairments in engaging with the society during the pandemic.&#x0D;

Floodings represent a permanent risk to the Netherlands in general and to her power supply in particular. Data sharing is essential within this crisis scenario as a power cut affects a great variety of interdependant sectors. Currently used data sharing systems have been shown to hamper interoperability between stakeholders since they lack flexibility and there is no consensus in term definitions and interpretations. The study presented in this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new data sharing solution based on Linked Data, a method of interlinking data points in a structured way on the web. A conceptual model for two data sharing parties in a flood-caused power cut crisis management scenario was developed to which relevant data were linked. The analysis revealed that the presented data sharing solution burderns its user with extra costs in the short run, but saves resources in the long run by overcoming interoperability problems of the legacy systems. The more stakeholders adopt Linked Data the stronger its benefits for data sharing will become.

We computed high-resolution (1º latitude x  1º longitude) seasonal and annual nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration fields for the Arabian Sea surface layer using a database containing more than 2400 values measured between December 1977 and July 1997. N2O concentrations are highest during the southwest (SW) monsoon along the southern Indian continental shelf. Annual emissions range from 0.33 to 0.70 Tg N2O and are dominated by fluxes from coastal regions during the SW and northeast monsoons. Our revised estimate for the annual N2O flux from the Arabian Sea is much more tightly constrained than the previous consensus derived using averaged in-situ data from a smaller number of studies. However, the tendency to focus on measurements in locally restricted features in combination with insufficient seasonal data coverage leads to considerable uncertainties of the concentration fields and thus in the flux estimates, especially in the coastal zones of the northern and eastern Arabian Sea. The overall mean relative error of the annual N2O emissions from the Arabian Sea was estimated to be at least 65%.

Aerosol number distribution measurements are reported at San Pietro Capofiume (SPC) station (44°39' N, 11°37' E) for the time period 2002–2005. The station is located in Po Valley, the largest industrial, trading and agricultural area in Italy with a high population density. New particle formation was studied based on observations of the particle size distribution, meteorological and gas phase parameters. The nucleation events were classified according to the event clarity based on the particle number concentrations, and the particle formation and growth rates. Out of a total of 769 operational days from 2002 to 2005 clear events were detected on 36% of the days whilst 33% are clearly non-event days. The event frequency was high during spring and summer months with maximum values in May and July, whereas lower frequency was observed in winter and autumn months. The average particle formation and growth rates were estimated as ~6 cm−3 s−1 and ~7 nm h−1, respectively. Such high growth and formation rates are typical for polluted areas. Temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, SO2 and O3 concentrations were on average higher on nucleation days than on non-event days, whereas relative and absolute humidity and NO2 concentration were lower; however, seasonal differences were observed. Backtrajectory analysis suggests that during majority of nucleation event days, the air masses originate from northern to eastern directions. We also study previously developed nucleation event correlations with environmental variables and show that they predict Po Valley nucleation events with variable success.

The Indian Ocean (44° S–30° N) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, yet it remains one of the most poorly sampled ocean regions. Several approaches have been used to estimate net sea–air CO2 fluxes in this region: interpolated observations, ocean biogeochemical models, atmospheric and ocean inversions. As part of the RECCAP (REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes) project, we combine these different approaches to quantify and assess the magnitude and variability in Indian Ocean sea–air CO2 fluxes between 1990 and 2009. Using all of the models and inversions, the median annual mean sea–air CO2 uptake of −0.37 ± 0.06 PgC yr−1 is consistent with the −0.24 ± 0.12 PgC yr−1 calculated from observations. The fluxes from the southern Indian Ocean (18–44° S; −0.43 ± 0.07 PgC yr−1 are similar in magnitude to the annual uptake for the entire Indian Ocean. All models capture the observed pattern of fluxes in the Indian Ocean with the following exceptions: underestimation of upwelling fluxes in the northwestern region (off Oman and Somalia), overestimation in the northeastern region (Bay of Bengal) and underestimation of the CO2 sink in the subtropical convergence zone. These differences were mainly driven by lack of atmospheric CO2 data in atmospheric inversions, and poor simulation of monsoonal currents and freshwater discharge in ocean biogeochemical models. Overall, the models and inversions do capture the phase of the observed seasonality for the entire Indian Ocean but overestimate the magnitude. The predicted sea–air CO2 fluxes by ocean biogeochemical models (OBGMs) respond to seasonal variability with strong phase lags with reference to climatological CO2 flux, whereas the atmospheric inversions predicted an order of magnitude higher seasonal flux than OBGMs. The simulated interannual variability by the OBGMs is weaker than that found by atmospheric inversions. Prediction of such weak interannual variability in CO2 fluxes by atmospheric inversions was mainly caused by a lack of atmospheric data in the Indian Ocean. The OBGM models suggest a small strengthening of the sink over the period 1990–2009 of −0.01 PgC decade−1. This is inconsistent with the observations in the southwestern Indian Ocean that shows the growth rate of oceanic pCO2 was faster than the observed atmospheric CO2 growth, a finding attributed to the trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) during the 1990s.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in northern peatlands and permafrost-affected soils are key components in the global carbon cycle. This article quantifies SOC stocks in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland environment in the discontinuous permafrost zone in Abisko, northern Sweden. Four machine-learning techniques are evaluated for SOC quantification: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine and random forest. The random forest model performed best and was used to predict SOC for several depth increments at a spatial resolution of 1 m (1×1 m). A high-resolution (1 m) land cover classification generated for this study is the most relevant predictive variable. The landscape mean SOC storage (0–150 cm) is estimated to be 8.3 ± 8.0 kg C m−2 and the SOC stored in the top meter (0–100 cm) to be 7.7 ± 6.2 kg C m−2. The predictive modeling highlights the relative importance of wetland areas and in particular peat plateaus for the landscape's SOC storage. The total SOC was also predicted at reduced spatial resolutions of 2, 10, 30, 100, 250 and 1000 m and shows a significant drop in land cover class detail and a tendency to underestimate the SOC at resolutions  &gt;  30 m. This is associated with the occurrence of many small-scale wetlands forming local hot-spots of SOC storage that are omitted at coarse resolutions. Sharp transitions in SOC storage associated with land cover and permafrost distribution are the most challenging methodological aspect. However, in this study, at local, regional and circum-Arctic scales, the main factor limiting robust SOC mapping efforts is the scarcity of soil pedon data from across the entire environmental space. For the Abisko region, past SOC and permafrost dynamics indicate that most of the SOC is barely 2000 years old and very dynamic. Future research needs to investigate the geomorphic response of permafrost degradation and the fate of SOC across all landscape compartments in post-permafrost landscapes."

Biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation provides the major source of
new nitrogen (N) to the open ocean, contributing more than atmospheric
deposition and riverine inputs to the N supply. Yet the fate of the
diazotroph-derived N (DDN) in the planktonic food web is poorly understood.
The main goals of this study were (i) to quantify how much of DDN is released
to the dissolved pool during N2 fixation and how much is
transferred to bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton, and (ii) to compare
the DDN release and transfer efficiencies under contrasting N2
fixation activity and diversity in the oligotrophic waters of the western
tropical South Pacific (WTSP) Ocean. We used nanometre-scale secondary ion
mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) coupled with 15N2 isotopic
labelling and flow cytometry cell sorting to track the DDN transfer to
plankton, in regions where the diazotroph community was dominated by either
Trichodesmium or by UCYN-B. After 48 h, ∼ 20–40 % of the
N2 fixed during the experiment was released to the dissolved pool
when Trichodesmium dominated, while the DDN release was not
quantifiable when UCYN-B dominated; ∼ 7–15 % of the total fixed N
(net N2 fixation + release) was transferred to non-diazotrophic
plankton within 48 h, with higher transfer efficiencies (15 ± 3 %)
when UCYN-B dominated as compared to when Trichodesmium dominated
(9 ± 3 %). The pico-cyanobacteria Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus were the primary beneficiaries of the DDN
transferred (∼ 65–70 %), followed by heterotrophic bacteria
(∼ 23–34 %). The DDN transfer in bacteria was higher
(34 ± 7 %) in the UCYN-B-dominating experiment compared to the
Trichodesmium-dominating experiments (24 ± 5 %). Regarding
higher trophic levels, the DDN transfer to the dominant zooplankton species
was less efficient when the diazotroph community was dominated by
Trichodesmium (∼ 5–9 % of the DDN transfer) than when it
was dominated by UCYN-B (∼ 28 ± 13 % of the DDN transfer). To
our knowledge, this study provides the first quantification of DDN release
and transfer to phytoplankton, bacteria and zooplankton communities in open
ocean waters. It reveals that despite UCYN-B fix N2 at lower rates
compared to Trichodesmium in the WTSP, the DDN from UCYN-B is much
more available and efficiently transferred to the planktonic food web than
the DDN originating from Trichodesmium.

production (PP) were investigated along two transects (Belgica BG2014/14 and
GEOVIDE cruises) off the western Iberian Margin and the Bay of Biscay in
May 2014. Substantial N2 fixation activity was observed at 8 of the
10 stations sampled, ranging overall from 81 to
384 µmol N m−2 d−1 (0.7 to
8.2 nmol N L−1 d−1), with two sites close to the Iberian Margin
situated between 38.8 and 40.7∘ N yielding rates reaching up to 1355
and 1533 µmol N m−2 d−1. Primary production was
relatively lower along the Iberian Margin, with rates ranging from 33 to
59 mmol C m−2 d−1, while it increased towards the northwest
away from the peninsula, reaching as high as
135 mmol C m−2 d−1. In agreement with the area-averaged Chl a
satellite data contemporaneous with our study period, our results revealed
that post-bloom conditions prevailed at most sites, while at the
northwesternmost station the bloom was still ongoing. When converted to
carbon uptake using Redfield stoichiometry, N2 fixation could
support 1 % to 3 % of daily PP in the euphotic layer at most sites,
except at the two most active sites where this contribution to daily PP could
reach up to 25 %. At the two sites where N2 fixation activity
was the highest, the prymnesiophyte–symbiont Candidatus
Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (UCYN-A) dominated the nifH sequence
pool, while the remaining recovered sequences belonged to non-cyanobacterial
phylotypes. At all the other sites, however, the recovered nifH
sequences were exclusively assigned phylogenetically to non-cyanobacterial
phylotypes. The intense N2 fixation activities recorded at the time
of our study were likely promoted by the availability of
phytoplankton-derived organic matter produced during the spring bloom, as
evidenced by the significant surface particulate organic carbon
concentrations. Also, the presence of excess phosphorus signature in surface
waters seemed to contribute to sustaining N2 fixation, particularly
at the sites with extreme activities. These results provide a mechanistic
understanding of the unexpectedly high N2 fixation in productive
waters of the temperate North Atlantic and highlight the importance of
N2 fixation for future assessment of the global N inventory.

The Bay of Bengal (BoB) has long stood as a biogeochemical enigma, with subsurface waters containing extremely low, but persistent, concentrations of oxygen in the nanomolar range which – for some, yet unconstrained, reason – are prevented from becoming anoxic. One reason for this may be the low productivity of the BoB waters due to nutrient limitation and the resulting lack of respiration of organic material at intermediate waters. Thus, the parameters determining primary production are key in understanding what prevents the BoB from developing anoxia. Primary productivity in the sunlit surface layers of tropical oceans is mostly limited by the supply of reactive nitrogen through upwelling, riverine flux, atmospheric deposition, and biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation. In the BoB, a stable stratification limits nutrient supply via upwelling in the open waters, and riverine or atmospheric fluxes have been shown to support only less than one-quarter of the nitrogen for primary production. This leaves a large uncertainty for most of the BoB's nitrogen input, suggesting a potential role of N2 fixation in those waters. Here, we present a survey of N2 fixation and carbon fixation in the BoB during the winter monsoon season. We detected a community of N2 fixers comparable to other oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) regions, with only a few cyanobacterial clades and a broad diversity of non-phototrophic N2 fixers present throughout the water column (samples collected between 10 and 560 m water depth). While similar communities of N2 fixers were shown to actively fix N2 in other OMZs, N2 fixation rates were below the detection limit in our samples covering the water column between the deep chlorophyll maximum and the OMZ. Consistent with this, no N2 fixation signal was visible in δ15N signatures. We suggest that the absence of N2 fixation may be a consequence of a micronutrient limitation or of an O2 sensitivity of the OMZ diazotrophs in the BoB. Exploring how the onset of N2 fixation by cyanobacteria compared to non-phototrophic N2 fixers would impact on OMZ O2 concentrations, a simple model exercise was carried out. We observed that both photic-zone-based and OMZ-based N2 fixation are very sensitive to even minimal changes in water column stratification, with stronger mixing increasing organic matter production and export, which can exhaust remaining O2 traces in the BoB."

We performed N budgets at three stations in the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) Ocean during austral summer conditions (Feb. Mar. 2015) and quantified all major N fluxes both entering the system (N2 fixation, nitrate eddy diffusion, atmospheric deposition) and leaving the system (PN export). Thanks to a Lagrangian strategy, we sampled the same water mass for the entire duration of each long duration (5 days) station, allowing to consider only vertical exchanges. Two stations located at the western end of the transect (Melanesian archipelago (MA) waters, LD A and LD B) were oligotrophic and characterized by a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) located at 51 ± 18 m and 81 ± 9 m at LD A and LD B. Station LD C was characterized by a DCM located at 132 ± 7 m, representative of the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific gyre (SPG water). N2 fixation rates were extremely high at both LD A (593 ± 51 µmol N m−2 d−1) and LD B (706 ± 302 µmol N m−2 d−1), and the diazotroph community was dominated by Trichodesmium. N2 fixation rates were lower (59 ± 16 µmol N m−2 d−1) at LD C and the diazotroph community was dominated by unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacteria (UCYN). At all stations, N2 fixation was the major source of new N (&gt; 90 %) before atmospheric deposition and upward nitrate fluxes induced by turbulence. N2 fixation contributed circa 8–12 % of primary production in the MA region and 3 % in the SPG water and sustained nearly all new primary production at all stations. The e-ratio (e-ratio = PC export/PP) was maximum at LD A (9.7 %) and was higher than the e-ratio in most studied oligotrophic regions (~ 1 %), indicating a high efficiency of the WTSP to export carbon relative to primary production. The direct export of diazotrophs assessed by qPCR of the nifH gene in sediment traps represented up to 30.6 % of the PC export at LD A, while there contribution was 5 and

One of the major objectives of the BIOSOPE cruise, carried out on the R/V Atalante from October-November 2004 in the South Pacific Ocean, was to establish productivity rates along a zonal section traversing the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre (SPG). These results were then compared to measurements obtained from the nutrient – replete waters in the Chilean upwelling and around the Marquesas Islands. A dual 13C/15N isotope technique was used to estimate the carbon fixation rates, inorganic nitrogen uptake (including dinitrogen fixation), ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) regeneration and release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The SPG exhibited the lowest primary production rates (0.15 g C m−2 d−1), while rates were 7 to 20 times higher around the Marquesas Islands and in the Chilean upwelling, respectively. In the very low productive area of the SPG, most of the primary production was sustained by active regeneration processes that fuelled up to 95% of the biological nitrogen demand. Nitrification was active in the surface layer and often balanced the biological demand for nitrate, especially in the SPG. The percentage of nitrogen released as DON represented a large proportion of the inorganic nitrogen uptake (13–15% in average), reaching 26–41% in the SPG, where DON production played a major role in nitrogen cycling. Dinitrogen fixation was detectable over the whole study area; even in the Chilean upwelling, where rates as high as 3 nmoles l−1 d−1 were measured. In these nutrient-replete waters new production was very high (0.69±0.49 g C m−2 d−1) and essentially sustained by nitrate levels. In the SPG, dinitrogen fixation, although occurring at much lower daily rates (≈1–2 nmoles l−1 d−1), sustained up to 100% of the new production (0.008±0.007 g C m−2 d−1) which was two orders of magnitude lower than that measured in the upwelling. The annual N2-fixation of the South Pacific is estimated to 21×1012g, of which 1.34×1012g is for the SPG only. Even if our ""snapshot"" estimates of N2-fixation rates were lower than that expected from a recent ocean circulation model, these data confirm that the N-deficiency South Pacific Ocean would provide an ideal ecological niche for the proliferation of N2-fixers which are not yet identified.

We have determined the latitudinal distribution of Trichodesmium spp. abundance and community N2 fixation in the Atlantic Ocean along a meridional transect from ca. 30° N to 30° S in November–December 2007 and April–May 2008. The observations from both cruises were highly consistent in terms of absolute magnitude and latitudinal distribution, showing a strong association between Trichodesmium abundance and community N2 fixation. The highest Trichodesmium abundances (mean = 220 trichomes L−1,) and community N2 fixation rates (mean = 60 μmol m−2 d−1) occurred in the Equatorial region between 5° S–15° N. In the South Atlantic gyre, Trichodesmium abundance was very low (ca. 1 trichome L−1) but N2 fixation was always measurable, averaging 3 and 10 μmol m2 d−1 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. We suggest that N2 fixation in the South Atlantic was sustained by other, presumably unicellular, diazotrophs. Comparing these distributions with the geographical pattern in atmospheric dust deposition points to iron supply as the main factor determining the large scale latitudinal variability of Trichodesmium spp. abundance and N2 fixation in the Atlantic Ocean. We observed a marked South to North decrease in surface phosphate concentration, which argues against a role for phosphorus availability in controlling the large scale distribution of N2 fixation. Scaling up from all our measurements (42 stations) results in conservative estimates for total N2 fixation of ∼6 TgN yr−1 in the North Atlantic (0–40° N) and ~1.2 TgN yr−1 in the South Atlantic (0–40° S).

Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picophytoeukaryotes and bacterioplankton abundances and contributions to the total particulate organic carbon concentration (POC), derived from the total particle beam attenuation coefficient (cp), were determined across the eastern South Pacific between the Marquesas Islands and the coast of Chile. All flow cytometrically derived abundances decreased towards the hyper-oligotrophic centre of the gyre and were highest at the coast, except for Prochlorococcus, which is not detected under eutrophic conditions. Temperature and nutrient availability appeared important in modulating picophytoplankton abundance, according to the prevailing trophic conditions. Although the non-vegetal particles tended to dominate the cp signal everywhere along the transect (50 to 83%), this dominance seemed to weaken from oligo- to eutrophic conditions, the contributions by vegetal and non-vegetal particles being about equal under mature upwelling conditions. Spatial variability in the vegetal compartment was more important than the non-vegetal one in shaping the water column particulate attenuation coefficient. Spatial variability in picophytoplankton biomass could be traced by changes in both Tchla and cp. Finally, picophytoeukaryotes contributed with ~38% on average to the total integrated phytoplankton carbon biomass or vegetal attenuation signal along the transect, as determined by direct size measurements on cells sorted by flow cytometry and optical theory. The role of picophytoeukaryotes in carbon and energy flow would therefore be very important, even under hyper-oligotrophic conditions.

Coastal upwelling ecosystems with marked oxyclines (redoxclines) present high availability of electron donors that favour chemoautotrophy, leading in turn to high N2O and CH4 cycling associated with aerobic NH4+ (AAO) and CH4 oxidation (AMO). This is the case of the highly productive coastal upwelling area off Central Chile (36° S), where we evaluated the importance of total chemolithoautotrophic vs. photoautotrophic production, the specific contributions of AAO and AMO to chemosynthesis and their role in gas cycling. Chemoautotrophy (involving bacteria and archaea) was studied at a time-series station during monthly (2002–2009) and seasonal cruises (January 2008, September 2008, January 2009) and was assessed in terms of dark carbon assimilation (CA), N2O and CH4 cycling, and the natural C isotopic ratio of particulate organic carbon (δ13POC). Total Integrated dark CA fluctuated between 19.4 and 2.924 mg C m−2 d−1. It was higher during active upwelling and represented on average 27% of the integrated photoautotrophic production (from 135 to 7.626 mg C m−2d−1). At the oxycline, δ13POC averaged -22.209‰ this was significantly lighter compared to the surface (-19.674‰) and bottom layers (-20.716‰). This pattern, along with low NH4+ content and high accumulations of N2O, NO2- and NO3- within the oxycline indicates that chemolithoautotrophs and specifically AA oxydisers were active. Dark CA was reduced from 27 to 48% after addition of a specific AAO inhibitor (ATU) and from 24 to 76% with GC7, a specific archaea inhibitor, indicating that AAO and maybe AMO microbes (most of them archaea) were performing dark CA through oxidation of NH4+ and CH4. AAO produced N2O at rates from 8.88 to 43 nM d−1 and a fraction of it was effluxed into the atmosphere (up to 42.85 μmol m−2 d−1). AMO on the other hand consumed CH4 at rates between 0.41 and 26.8 nM d−1 therefore preventing its efflux to the atmosphere (up to 18.69 μmol m−2 d−1). These findings show that chemically driven chemoautotrophy (with NH4+ and CH4 acting as electron donors) could be more important than previously thought in upwelling ecosystems and open new questions concerning its future relevance."

Climate sensitivity to CO2 remains the key uncertainty in projections of future climate change. Transient climate response (TCR) is the metric of temperature sensitivity that is most relevant to warming in the next few decades and contributes the biggest uncertainty to estimates of the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris targets. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is vital for understanding longer-term climate change and stabilisation targets. In the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), the stated “likely” ranges (16 %–84 % confidence) of TCR (1.0–2.5 K) and ECS (1.5–4.5 K) were broadly consistent with the ensemble of CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) available at the time. However, many of the latest CMIP6 ESMs have larger climate sensitivities, with 5 of 34 models having TCR values above 2.5 K and an ensemble mean TCR of 2.0±0.4 K. Even starker, 12 of 34 models have an ECS value above 4.5 K. On the face of it, these latest ESM results suggest that the IPCC likely ranges may need revising upwards, which would cast further doubt on the feasibility of the Paris targets. Here we show that rather than increasing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the CMIP6 models help to constrain the likely range of TCR to 1.3–2.1 K, with a central estimate of 1.68 K. We reach this conclusion through an emergent constraint approach which relates the value of TCR linearly to the global warming from 1975 onwards. This is a period when the signal-to-noise ratio of the net radiative forcing increases strongly, so that uncertainties in aerosol forcing become progressively less problematic. We find a consistent emergent constraint on TCR when we apply the same method to CMIP5 models. Our constraints on TCR are in good agreement with other recent studies which analysed CMIP ensembles. The relationship between ECS and the post-1975 warming trend is less direct and also non-linear. However, we are able to derive a likely range of ECS of 1.9–3.4 K from the CMIP6 models by assuming an underlying emergent relationship based on a two-box energy balance model. Despite some methodological differences; this is consistent with a previously published ECS constraint derived from warming trends in CMIP5 models to 2005. Our results seem to be part of a growing consensus amongst studies that have applied the emergent constraint approach to different model ensembles and to different aspects of the record of global warming.

The Baltic Sea Region is very sensitive to climate change; it is a region with spatially varying climate and diverse ecosystems, but also under pressure due to high population in large parts of the area. Climate change impacts could easily exacerbate other anthropogenic stressors such as biodiversity stress from society and eutrophication of the Baltic Sea considerably. Therefore, there has been a focus on estimations of future climate change and its impacts in recent research. In this review paper, we will concentrate on a presentation of recent climate projections from both atmosphere-only and coupled atmosphere-ocean regional climate models. The recent regional climate model projections strengthen the picture from previous assessments. This includes a strong warming, in particular in the north in winter. Precipitation is projected to increase in the whole region apart from the southern half during summer. Consequently, the new results lend more credibility to estimates of uncertainties and robust features of future climate change. Furthermore, the larger number of scenarios gives opportunities to better address impacts of mitigation measures. The coupled atmosphere-ocean model locally modifies the climate change signal relative to that in the stand-alone atmosphere regional climate model. Differences are largest in areas where the coupled system arrives at different sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice conditions.

Climate change causes global mean sea level to rise due to thermal expansion of seawater and loss of land ice from mountain glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Locally, sea level can strongly deviate from the global mean rise due to changes in wind and ocean currents. In addition, gravitational adjustments redistribute seawater away from shrinking ice masses. However, the land ice contribution to sea level rise (SLR) remains very challenging to model, and comprehensive regional sea level projections, which include appropriate gravitational adjustments, are still a nascent field (Katsman et al., 2011; Slangen et al., 2011). Here, we present an alternative approach to derive regional sea level changes for a range of emission and land ice melt scenarios, combining probabilistic forecasts of a simple climate model (MAGICC6) with the new CMIP5 general circulation models.  The contribution from ice sheets varies considerably depending on the assumptions for the ice sheet projections, and thus represents sizeable uncertainties for future sea level rise. However, several consistent and robust patterns emerge from our analysis: at low latitudes, especially in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, sea level will likely rise more than the global mean (mostly by 10–20%). Around the northeastern Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific coasts, sea level will rise less than the global average or, in some rare cases, even fall. In the northwestern Atlantic, along the American coast, a strong dynamic sea level rise is counteracted by gravitational depression due to Greenland ice melt; whether sea level will be above- or below-average will depend on the relative contribution of these two factors. Our regional sea level projections and the diagnosed uncertainties provide an improved basis for coastal impact analysis and infrastructure planning for adaptation to climate change.

Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C"". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 % in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 % to 17 % between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 %. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 % compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming."

In this study, we produce a set of scenarios using a simple model designed to achieve long-term 1.5 and 2 °C temperatures in a stable climate. These scenarios are then used to produce century-scale ensemble simulations using the Community Earth System Model, providing impact-relevant long-term climate data for stabilization pathways at 1.5 and 2 °C levels and an overshoot 1.5 °C case, which are realized (for the 21st century) in the coupled model and are freely available to the community. Here we describe the design of the simulations and a brief overview of their impact-relevant climate response. Exceedance of historical record temperature occurs with 60 % greater frequency in the 2 °C climate than in a 1.5 °C climate aggregated globally, and with twice the frequency in equatorial and arid regions. Extreme precipitation intensity is statistically significantly higher in a 2.0 °C climate than a 1.5 °C climate in some specific regions (but not all). The model exhibits large differences in the Arctic, which is ice-free with a frequency of 1 in 3 years in the 2.0 °C scenario, and 1 in 40 years in the 1.5 °C scenario. Significance of impact differences with respect to multi-model variability is not assessed.

We describe here the development and evaluation of an Earth system model suitable for centennial-scale climate prediction. The principal new components added to the physical climate model are the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems and gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, along with their coupled interactions.  The individual Earth system components are described briefly and the relevant interactions between the components are explained. Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced. This spun-up configuration is evaluated against observed data for the Earth system components and is generally found to perform very satisfactorily. The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight.  This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.

The core version of the Norwegian Climate Center's Earth System Model, named NorESM1-M, is presented. The NorESM family of models are based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, but differs from the latter by, in particular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model and advanced chemistry–aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction schemes. NorESM1-M has a horizontal resolution of approximately 2° for the atmosphere and land components and 1° for the ocean and ice components. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version (NorESM1-L) and a version that includes prognostic biogeochemical cycling (NorESM1-ME). The latter two model configurations are not part of this paper. Here, a first-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability based on the model experiments made available to CMIP5 are presented. Further analysis of the model performance is provided in an accompanying paper (Iversen et al., 2013), presenting the corresponding climate response and scenario projections made with NorESM1-M.

The recently developed Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM) is employed for simulations contributing to the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) experiments and the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5). In this manuscript, we focus on evaluating the ocean and land carbon cycle components of the NorESM, based on the control and historical simulations. Many of the observed large scale ocean biogeochemical features are reproduced satisfactorily by the NorESM. When compared to the climatological estimates from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA), the model simulated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and phosphate distributions agree reasonably well in both the surface layer and deep water structure. However, the model simulates a relatively strong overturning circulation strength that leads to noticeable model-data bias, especially within the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This strong overturning circulation slightly distorts the structure of the biogeochemical tracers at depth. Advancements in simulating the oceanic mixed layer depth with respect to the previous generation model particularly improve the surface tracer distribution as well as the upper ocean biogeochemical processes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, near surface ocean processes such as biological production and air-sea gas exchange, are in good agreement with climatological observations. NorESM reproduces the general pattern of land-vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) when compared to the observationally-based values derived from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers. Globally, the NorESM simulated annual mean GPP and terrestrial respiration are 129.8 and 106.6 Pg C yr−1, slightly larger than observed of 119.4 ± 5.9 and 96.4 ± 6.0 Pg C yr−1. The latitudinal distribution of GPP fluxes simulated by NorESM shows a GPP overestimation of 10% in the tropics and a substantial underestimation of GPP at high latitudes."

ANALYTICAL URBAN DASHBOARD",http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R74230,Urban Studies,"Abstract. As many cities increase in size across multiple dimensions such as population, economic output and physical size, new methods for understanding and managing cities are required. Data produced by and about urban environments offer insight into what is happening in cities. Real-time data from sensors within the city record current transport and environmental conditions such as noise levels, water levels, journey times and public transport delays. Similarly administrative data such as demographics, employment statistics, property prices and crime rates all provide insight into how a city is evolving. Traditionally, these data were maintained separately and managed by individual city departments. Advances in technology and a move to open-government have placed many of these data in the public domain. Urban dashboards have emerged as a technique to visualise these data in an accessible way. This paper describes the implementation of one such dashboard, the Dublin Dashboard, an interactive website which collects, analyses and visualises data from a variety of sources about Dublin in Ireland through a series of interactive maps, graphs and applications. This paper describes the approach, the data and the technology used to develop the Dublin Dashboard and acts as a guideline for developing urban dashboards in other cities.

In 2017 we published a seminal research study in the International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing &amp;amp; Spatial Information Sciences about how smart city tools, solutions and applications underpinned historical and cultural heritage of cities at that time (Angelidou et al. 2017). We now return to investigate the progress that has been made during the past three years, and specifically whether the weak substantiation of cultural heritage in smart city strategies that we observed in 2017 has been improved. The newest literature suggests that smart cities should capitalize on local strengths and give prominence to local culture and traditions and provides a handful of solutions to this end. However, a more thorough examination of what has been actually implemented reveals a (still) rather immature approach. The smart city cases that were selected for the purposes of this research include Tarragona (Spain), Budapest (Hungary) and Karlsruhe (Germany). For each one we collected information regarding the overarching structure of the initiative, the positioning of cultural heritage and the inclusion of heritage-related smart city applications. We then performed a comparative analysis based on a simplified version of the Digital Strategy Canvas. Our findings suggest that a rich cultural heritage and a broader strategic focus on touristic branding and promotion are key ingredients of smart city development in this domain; this is a commonality of all the investigated cities. Moreover, three different strategy architectures emerge, representing the different interplays among the smart city, cultural heritage and sustainable urban development. We conclude that a new generation of smart city initiatives is emerging, in which cultural heritage is of increasing importance. This generation tends to associate cultural heritage with social and cultural values, liveability and sustainable urban development.

The latest coronavirus (namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China, and spread throughout the world since December 2019. To tackle this pandemic, we need a tool to trace and predict trends of COVID-19 at global, national, and regional levels rapidly. Several organizations around the world offer access to COVID-19 related data. However, these data sources are heterogeneous in terms of data formats and protocols as different organizations developed them. To address this issue, a standard way to handle these datasets is needed. In this paper, we propose using the OGC SensorThings API to manage the COVID-19 dataset in a standard form and provide access to the general public. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a COVID-19 data management platform based on the OGC SensorThings standard named COVID-19 SensorThings or in short COVID-STA. For a use case, we developed a real-time interactive web-based dashboard illustrating the COVID-19 dataset based on the COVID-STA. As a result, we proved that the OGC SensorThings API is suitable to use as a general standard for integrating the heterogeneous COVID-19 data.

The kharif rice area (2018–19) was derived using multi-date Sentinel-1A(Microwave SAR) data under FASAL project. The expected harvesting dates of kharif rice (crop duration 140 days) are derived on the basis of transplanting dates (derived from SAR data), NDVI profiles and Ground truth data. Daily active crop fire events in Punjab and Haryana were taken from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) product in the month of October and November 2018. It was observed from the study that the crop fire events showed a similar pattern as observed in expected harvest dates. Multi-date AWiFS data used to identify the crop residues- burnt areas during October and November 2018. The study reveals that maximum rice residue burning period is 2nd fortnight of October to 1st fortnight of November in both the states Punjab and Haryana. Maximum burning density was observed in the Mansa and Bhatinda district of Punjab and Fatehabad district of Haryana. In total 2.63 lakh ha burnt area was estimated in Haryana which is 20% of total kharif rice acreage while in Punjab it is 18.7 lakh ha (66% of total kharif rice acreage). Thus this study could show the relationship between the satellites derived harvesting dates and the spread of crop fire events. Monitoring of crop residue burning at regular intervals especially before each crop harvesting season to ensure effective implementation of proactive measures to curb the practice of burning of crop residue.

Classification of crops is very important to study different growth stages and forecast yield. Remote sensing data plays a significant role in crop identification and condition assessment over a large spatial scale. Importance of Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) along with surface reflectances of remotely sensed spectral bands have been evaluated for classification of eight types of Rabi crops utilizing the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets and performances of both the satellites are compared. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A images are acquired for the location of crops and seven and nine spectral bands are utilized respectively for the classification. Experiments are carried out considering the different combinations of surface reflectances of spectral bands and optimal NDIs as features in support vector machine classifier. Optimal NDIs are selected from the set of 7C2 and 9C2 NDIs of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A datasets respectively using the partial informational correlation measure, a nonparametric feature selection approach. Few important vegetation indices (e.g. enhanced vegetation index) are also experimented in combination with the surface reflectances and NDIs to perform the crop classification. It has been observed that combination of surface reflectances and optimal NDIs can classify the crops more efficiently. The average overall accuracy of 80.96% and 88.16% are achieved using the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A datasets respectively. It has been observed that all the crop classes except Paddy and Cotton achieve producer accuracy and user accuracy of more than 75% and 85% respectively. This technique can be implemented for crop identification with adequate accessibility of crop information.

Reliably ship detection in optical satellite images has a wide application in both military and civil fields. However, this problem is very difficult in complex backgrounds, such as waves, clouds, and small islands. Aiming at these issues, this paper explores an automatic and robust model for ship detection in large-scale optical satellite images, which relies on detecting statistical signatures of ship targets, in terms of biologically-inspired visual features. This model first selects salient candidate regions across large-scale images by using a mechanism based on biologically-inspired visual features, combined with visual attention model with local binary pattern (CVLBP). Different from traditional studies, the proposed algorithm is high-speed and helpful to focus on the suspected ship areas avoiding the separation step of land and sea. Largearea images are cut into small image chips and analyzed in two complementary ways: Sparse saliency using visual attention model and detail signatures using LBP features, thus accordant with sparseness of ship distribution on images. Then these features are employed to classify each chip as containing ship targets or not, using a support vector machine (SVM). After getting the suspicious areas, there are still some false alarms such as microwaves and small ribbon clouds, thus simple shape and texture analysis are adopted to distinguish between ships and nonships in suspicious areas. Experimental results show the proposed method is insensitive to waves, clouds, illumination and ship size.

Reliable ship detection plays an important role in both military and civil fields. However, it makes the task difficult with high-resolution remote sensing images with complex background and various types of ships with different poses, shapes and scales. Related works mostly used gray and shape features to detect ships, which obtain results with poor robustness and efficiency. To detect ships more automatically and robustly, we propose a novel ship detection method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called SCNN, fed with specifically designed proposals extracted from the ship model combined with an improved saliency detection method. Firstly we creatively propose two ship models, the “V” ship head model and the “||” ship body one, to localize the ship proposals from the line segments extracted from a test image. Next, for offshore ships with relatively small sizes, which cannot be efficiently picked out by the ship models due to the lack of reliable line segments, we propose an improved saliency detection method to find these proposals. Therefore, these two kinds of ship proposals are fed to the trained CNN for robust and efficient detection. Experimental results on a large amount of representative remote sensing images with different kinds of ships with varied poses, shapes and scales demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed S-CNN-Based ship detector.

After a long period of drought, the water level of the Danube River has significantly dropped especially on the Romanian sector, in July-August 2015. Danube reached the lowest water level recorded in the last 12 years, causing the blockage of the ships in the sector located close to Zimnicea Harbour. The rising sand banks in the navigable channel congested the commercial traffic for a few days with more than 100 ships involved. The monitoring of the decreasing water level and the traffic jam was performed based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 free data provided by the European Space Agency and the European Commission within the Copernicus Programme. Specific processing methods (calibration, speckle filtering, geocoding, change detection, image classification, principal component analysis, etc.) were applied in order to generate useful products that the responsible authorities could benefit from. The Sentinel data yielded good results for water mask extraction and ships detection. The analysis continued after the closure of the crisis situation when the water reached the nominal level again. The results indicate that Sentinel data can be successfully used for ship traffic monitoring, building the foundation of future endeavours for a durable monitoring of the Danube River.

Remote sensing is a rapid and reliable method for estimating crop growth data from individual plant to crops in irrigated agriculture ecosystem. The LAI is one of the important biophysical parameter for determining vegetation health, biomass, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration (ET) for the modelling of crop yield and water productivity. Ground measurement of this parameter is tedious and time-consuming due to heterogeneity across the landscape over time and space. This study deals with the development of remote-sensing based empirical relationships for the estimation of ground-based LAI (LAIG) using NDVI, modelled with and without atmospheric correction models for three irrigated crops (corn, wheat and rice) grown in irrigated farms within Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) which is located in southern Murray Darling basin, NSW in Australia. Extensive ground truthing campaigns were carried out to measure crop growth and to collect field samples of LAI using LAI- 2000 Plant Canopy Analyser and reflectance using CROPSCAN Multi Spectral Radiometer at several farms within the CIA. A Set of 12 cloud free Landsat 5 TM satellite images for the period of 2010-11 were downloaded and regression analysis was carried out to analyse the co-relationships between satellite and ground measured reflectance and to check the reliability of data sets for the crops. Among all the developed regression relationships between LAI and NDVI, the atmospheric correction process has significantly improved the relationship between LAI and NDVI for Landsat 5 TM images. The regression analysis also shows strong correlations for corn and wheat but weak correlations for rice which is currently being investigated.

Vessel monitoring and surveillance is important for maritime safety and security, environment protection and border control. Ship monitoring systems based on Synthetic-aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images are operational. On SAR images the ships made of metal with sharp edges appear as bright dots and edges, therefore they can be well distinguished from the water. Since the radar is independent from the sun light and can acquire images also by cloudy weather and rain, it provides a reliable service. Vessel detection from spaceborne optical images (VDSOI) can extend the SAR based systems by providing more frequent revisit times and overcoming some drawbacks of the SAR images (e.g. lower spatial resolution, difficult human interpretation). Optical satellite images (OSI) can have a higher spatial resolution thus enabling the detection of smaller vessels and enhancing the vessel type classification. The human interpretation of an optical image is also easier than as of SAR image. In this paper I present a rapid automatic vessel detection method which uses pattern recognition methods, originally developed in the computer vision field. In the first step I train a binary classifier from image samples of vessels and background. The classifier uses simple features which can be calculated very fast. For the detection the classifier is slided along the image in various directions and scales. The detector has a cascade structure which rejects most of the background in the early stages which leads to faster execution. The detections are grouped together to avoid multiple detections. Finally the position, size(i.e. length and width) and heading of the vessels is extracted from the contours of the vessel. The presented method is parallelized, thus it runs fast (in minutes for 16000 × 16000 pixels image) on a multicore computer, enabling near real-time applications, e.g. one hour from image acquisition to end user.

One of the most progressive and effective methods of acquisition and analyzing spatial data is terrestrial laser scanning. The study of methods and technologies for terrestrial laser scanning is of great importance not only for GIS specialists, but also for surveying engineers who make decisions in traditional engineering tasks (monitoring, executive surveys, etc.). The understanding and formation of the right approach in preparing new professionals need to develop a modern and variable educational program. This educational program must provide effective practical and laboratory work and the student’s coursework. The resulting knowledge of the study should form the basis for practical or research of young engineers. In 2014, the Institute of Applied Sciences (Jade University Oldenburg, Germany) and Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture (Kiev, Ukraine) had launched a joint educational project for the introduction of terrestrial laser scanning technology for collection and processing of spatial data. As a result of this project practical recommendations have been developed for the organization of educational processes in the use of terrestrial laser scanning. An advanced project-oriented educational program was developed which is presented in this paper. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the program a 3D model of the big and complex main campus of Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture has been generated."

As the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) has the
potential to influence and mitigate climate change; thus, SOC monitoring is of high importance
in the frameworks of various international treaties. Therefore, high-resolution SOC maps are required. Machine learning (ML) offers new
opportunities to develop these maps due to its ability to data mine large
datasets. The aim of this study was to apply three algorithms commonly used
in digital soil mapping – random forest (RF), boosted regression trees
(BRT), and support vector machine for regression (SVR) – on the first German
agricultural soil inventory to model the agricultural topsoil (0–30 cm) SOC
content and develop a two-model approach to address the high variability in
SOC in German agricultural soils. Model performance is often limited by the
size and quality of the soil dataset available for calibration and
validation. Therefore, the impact of enlarging the training dataset was tested
by including data from the European Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey
for agricultural sites in Germany. Nested cross-validation was implemented
for model evaluation and parameter tuning. Grid search and the differential
evolution algorithm were also applied to ensure that each algorithm was
appropriately tuned . The SOC content of the German agricultural soil
inventory was highly variable, ranging from 4 to 480 g kg−1. However, only 4 % of all soils contained more than 87 g kg−1 SOC and were considered organic or degraded organic soils. The
results showed that SVR produced the best performance, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32 g kg−1 when the algorithms were trained on the full dataset. However, the
average RMSE of all algorithms decreased by 34 % when mineral and organic
soils were modelled separately, with the best result from SVR presenting an RMSE of
21 g kg−1. The model performance was enhanced by up to 1 % for
mineral soils and by up to 2 % for organic soils. Despite the ability of machine
learning algorithms, in general, and SVR, in particular, to model SOC on a
national scale, the study showed that the most important aspect for
improving the model performance was to separate the modelling of mineral and
organic soils.

The accurate and rapid extraction of glacier boundaries plays an
important role in the study of glacier inventory, glacier change and
glacier movement. With the successive launches of high-resolution
remote-sensing satellites and the increasing abundance of available
remote-sensing data, great opportunities and challenges now exist. In this
study, we improved the DeepLab V3+ as Attention DeepLab V3+ and
designed a complete solution based on the improved network to automatically
extract glacier outlines from Gaofen-6 panchromatic and multispectral (PMS) images with a spatial resolution
of 2 m. In the solution, test-time augmentation (TTA) was adopted to
increase model robustness, and the convolutional block attention module
(CBAM) was added into the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) structure in
DeepLab V3+ to enhance the weight of the target pixels and reduce the
impact of superfluous features. The results show that the improved model
effectively increases the robustness of the model, enhances the weight of
target image elements and reduces the influence of non-target elements.
Compared with deep-learning models, such as full convolutional network (FCN), U-Net and DeepLab V3+, the
improved model performs better in the test dataset. Moreover, our method
achieves superior performance for glacier boundary extraction in parts of
the Tanggula Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains and the Qilian Mountains based
on Gaofen-6 PMS images. It could distinguish glaciers from terminal moraine
lakes, thin snow and clouds, thus demonstrating excellent performance and
great potential for rapid and precise extraction of glacier boundaries.

Wind turbines are complex multidisciplinary systems that are challenging to design because of the tightly coupled interactions between different subsystems. Computational modeling attempts to resolve these couplings so we can efficiently explore new wind turbine systems early in the design process. Low-fidelity models are computationally efficient but make assumptions and simplifications that limit the accuracy of design studies, whereas high-fidelity models capture more of the actual physics but with increased computational cost. This paper details the use of multifidelity methods for optimizing wind turbine designs by using information from both low- and high-fidelity models to find an optimal solution at reduced cost. Specifically, a trust-region approach is used with a novel corrective function built from a nonlinear surrogate model. We find that for a diverse set of design problems – with examples given in rotor blade geometry design, wind turbine controller design, and wind power plant layout optimization – the multifidelity method finds the optimal design using 38 %–58 % of the computational cost of the high-fidelity-only optimization. The success of the multifidelity method in disparate applications suggests that it could be more broadly applied to other wind energy or otherwise generic applications.

The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) collects emergency department (ED) data from more than 70 hospitals across Tennessee to support statewide syndromic surveillance activities. Hospitals in Tennessee typically provide data within 48 hours of a patient encounter. While syndromic surveillance often supplements disease- or condition-specific surveillance, it can also provide general situational awareness about emergency department patients during an event or response.During Hurricanes Harvey (continental US landfall on August 25, 2017) and Irma (continental US landfall on September 10, 2017), TDH supported all hazards situational awareness using the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) in the BioSense Platform supported by the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). The volume of out-of-state patients in Tennessee was monitored to assess the impact on the healthcare system and any geographic- or hospital-specific clustering of out-of-state patients within Tennessee. Results were included in daily State Health Operations Center (SHOC) situation reports and shared with agency response partners such as the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA).MethodsData were monitored from August 18, 2017 through September 24, 2017. A simple query was established in ESSENCE using the Patient Location (Full Details) dataset. Data were limited to hospital ED visits reported by Tennessee (Site = “Tennessee”). To monitor ED visits among residents of Texas before, during, and after Major Hurricane Harvey, data were queried for a patient zip code within Texas (State = “Texas”). ED visits among Florida residents were monitored similarly (State = “Florida”) before, during, and after Major Hurricane Irma. Additionally, a free text chief complaint search was implemented for the terms “Harvey”, “Irma, “hurricane”, “evacuee”, “evacuate”, “Florida”, and “Texas”. Chief complaint search results were then filtered to remove encounters with patient zip codes within Tennessee.ResultsFrom August 18, 2017 through September 24, 2017, Tennessee hospital EDs reported 277 patient encounters among Texas residents and 1,041 patient encounters among Florida residents. The number of encounters among patients from Texas remained stable throughout the monitoring period. In contrast, the number of encounters among patients from Florida exceeded the expected value on September 7, peaked September 10 at 116 patient encounters, and returned to expected levels on September 16 (Figure 1). The increase in patients from Florida was evenly distributed across most of Tennessee, with some clustering around a popular tourism area in East Tennessee. No concerning trends in reported syndromes or chief complaints were identified among Texas or Florida patients.The free text chief complaint query first exceeded the expected value on September 9, peaked on September 11 with 5 patient encounters, and returned to expected levels on September 14. From August 18 through September 24, 21 of 30 visits captured by the query were among Florida residents. One Tennessee hospital appeared to be intentionally using the term “Irma” in their chief complaint field to indicate patients from Florida impacted by the hurricane.ConclusionsThe ESSENCE instance in the BioSense platform provided TDH the opportunity to easily locate and monitor out-of-state patients seen in Tennessee hospital EDs. While TDH was unable to validate whether all patients identified as residents of Florida were displaced because of Major Hurricane Irma, the timing of the rise and fall of patient encounters was highly suggestive. Likewise, seeing no substantial increase ED patients with residence in Texas reassured TDH that the effects of Hurricane Harvey were not impacting hospital emergency departments in Tennessee.TDH used information and charts from ESSENCE to support situational awareness in our SHOC and at TEMA. Use of patient zip code to identify out-of-state residents was more sensitive than chief complaint searches by keyword during this event. ESSENCE allowed TDH to see where out-of-state patients appeared to be concentrating in Tennessee and monitor the need for targeting messaging and resources to heavily affected areas. Additionally, close surveillance of chief complaints among out-of-state patients provided assurance that no unusual patterns in illness or injury were occurring.ESSENCE is the only TDH information source capable of rapidly collecting health information on out-of-state patients. ESSENCE allowed TDH to quickly identify a change within the patient population seen at Tennessee emergency departments and monitor the situation until the patient population returned to baseline levels."

Timeliness is a major concern with OME data due to the considerable lag in its availability, often up to six months or more. To enhance opioid overdose surveillance, UDOH has implemented additional surveillance using timely syndromic data to monitor fatal and nonfatal opioid-related overdoses in Utah.Methods: As one of the agencies participating in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), UDOH submits de-identified data on emergency department visit from Utah’s hospitals and urgent care facilities in close to real-time to the NSSP platform. Emergency department visit data are available for analysis using the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) system provided by NSSP. ESSENCE provides UDOH with patient-level syndromic data for analysis and early detection of abnormal patterns in emergency visits. A total of 38 out of 48 acute care hospitals and multiple urgent care facilities are enrolled in the system in Utah. More than 90% of these hospitals report chief complaint data, and discharge data are available from about 15% of the facilities. Data were analyzed by querying key terms in the chief complaint field including: any entry of: ‘overdose’, drug and brand names for opioids, street names, ‘naloxone’, and miss-spellings. Exclusion terms included any mention of: ‘denies’, ‘quit’, ‘refill’, ‘withdraw’, ‘dependence’, etc. Data containing any ICD entry of: T40.0-T40.4, T40.60, and T40.69 were included in the analysis.Results: Between September 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017, Utah Department of Health identified 4,063 opioid-related overdose emergency department (ED) visits through the ESSENCE system using both chief complaint and discharge diagnosis queries. Of these visits, 3,865 (95%) were identified using chief complaints alone and 198 (5%) visits were added by searching the discharge diagnosis field. Opioid-related visits comprised approximately 0.3% of the total ED visits (1,267,244) reported during this time (Graph 1). More than half of the opioid-related emergency visits were reported from just five facilities. Rate of opioid-related visits ranging from 0 to 292 visits per 100,000 population per year (median: 108 visits per 100,000 population per year), with an overall rate for the state of 129 visits per100, 000 population per year. The highest rate of opioid-related visits occurred among patients aged 18 to 24 (219 visits per 100,000 population per year), and 59% of all opioid-related patients in Utah were female.Conclusions: The results presented are estimates of opioid-related overdoses reported using close to real-time data. These results would not include visits with incomplete or incorrectly coded chief complaints or discharge codes, or cases of opioid overdose who do not present to an emergency department or urgent care facility. The results from using syndromic data are consistent with existing surveillance findings using mortality data in Utah. This suggests that syndromic surveillance data are useful for rapidly capturing opioid events, which may allow for a timelier public health response. UDOH is currently evaluating syndromic surveillance data versus hospital discharge data for opioid-related emergency department visits, which may further optimize queries in ESSENCE, in order to provide improved opioid surveillance data to local public health partners. This analysis demonstrates that using syndromic surveillance data provides a more time-efficient alternative, enabling more rapid public health interventions, which improved opportunities to reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality in Utah."

The results ofthis study may be further utilized in an effort to evaluate the currentMERS-CoV surveillance query.IntroductionHuman MERS-CoV was first reported in September 2012. Globally,all reported cases have been linked through travel to or residence inthe Arabian Peninsula with the exception of cases associated with anoutbreak involving multiple health care facilities in the Republic ofKorea ending in July 2015. While the majority of MERS-CoV caseshave been reported in the Arabian Peninsula, several cases have beenreported outside of the region. Most cases are believed to have beenacquired in the Middle East and then exported elsewhere, with no orrare instances of secondary transmission. Two cases of MERS-CoVwere exported to the United States and identified in May 2014. Oneof these cases traveled from Saudi Arabia to Florida.DOH conducts regular surveillance for MERS-CoV through theinvestigation of persons with known risk factors. PUIs have mostoften been identified by physicians reporting directly to local healthdepartments and by DOH staff regularly querying ED and UCC chiefcomplaint data in ESSENCE-FL. ESSENCE-FL currently capturesdata from 265 EDs and UCCs statewide and has been useful inidentifying cases associated with reportable disease and emergingpathogens.MethodsFrom 2013-2015 DOH identified and investigated 62 suspectedcases of MERS-CoV, including one confirmed case in May 2014.Specimens were collected from all 62 patients under investigation(PUIs) and 61 were ruled out. Of the 61 PUIs who were ruled out,ten were part of the contact investigation initiated following theidentification of MERS-CoV in May 2014 and were not included inthis analysis. DOH utilizes a MERS-CoV PUI case report form tocollect data regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and riskfactors. Retrospectively, additional documents including medicalrecords and discharge summaries were gathered and utilized toevaluate PUIs identified in ESSENCE-FL.Name of the facility where PUIs presented, date and time of visit,age at event, and sex were identified using PUI case report forms andcorresponding medical records and discharge summaries. Visit detailsfor each of the identified facilities were queried in ESSENCE-FLand pulled for all visits with corresponding age at event and sex forthe patient’s visit date. Additional PUI information including chiefcomplaint, discharge diagnosis, ZIP code, race, and ethnicity weregathered for the purpose of matching corresponding ESSENCE-FLdata fields. ESSENCE-FL visit details were narrowed by ZIP code (orlack of ZIP code for residents of other countries) and match detailswere recorded and evaluated. The fields examined were not alwayscomplete in ESSENCE-FL. Visits were considered matches when allavailable data in the fields examined were consistent with informationobtained in the PUI case report form and available medical recordsand discharge summaries.ResultsOf the 52 PUIs included in this analysis, 39 sought treatmentat facilities participating in ESSENCE-FL at their time of visit.Comparing information obtained from PUI documents with dataprovided in ESSENCE-FL, 30 ED visits were successfully matchedto PUIs, including an initial ED visit for the patient with a confirmedcase of MERS-CoV.ConclusionsFollowing preliminary identification, all matches are to beconfirmed with the appropriate hospitals. Future work to examine thechief complaints associated with patients’ initial ED visits identifiedin ESSENCE-FL will serve as a way to validate and improve uponthe query currently being used as a surveillance tool for MERS-CoV.Detailing these methods also has value in the replication of thisstudy for other diseases and in the development and validation ofother disease-specific queries. Summarizing the reasons why PUIswere unable to be matched to ESSENCE-FL visits is also useful inimproving system robustness."

This mass gathering included over 1,000athletes, 1,500 volunteers, and 175,000 spectators. The Oregon PublicHealth Division (PHD) and Lane County Public Health (LCPH)participated in pre-event planning and collaborated to produce adaily epidemiology report for the Incident Management Team (IMT)during the event. The state and county public health agencies hadcollaborated on surveillance for prior mass gatherings, including the2012 Trials. However, 2016 was the first opportunity to use completestate and county syndromic surveillance data.MethodsPHD staff developed an ESSENCE report, highlighting sevenpriority health outcomes: total emergency department visits; injury,gastrointestinal, respiratory, and fever syndromes; and asthma-like and heat-related illness queries. The report included side-by-side comparisons of county and state time series graphs, a tablesummarizing reportable diseases, and space to narratively describeoutbreaks. PHD staff did a virtual demonstration and in-persontutorial for LCPH staff on how to run the report. ESSENCE accesspermissions had to be modified so that county users could see andproduce state time-series graphs but not data details for non-LaneCounty visits. Emphasis was placed on interpretation of likelyscenarios, i.e., one or two days with a warning that was not indicativeof an incident of public health importance.ResultsDuring the event, LCPH staff were able to run the reportsuccessfully, i.e., there were no technical glitches. For the first fewdays, LCPH staff consulted with PHD staff about epidemiologicalinterpretation. State data were of specific interest since data detailswere suppressed. Additionally, increases were seen in the injurysyndrome in the days preceding the July 4 holiday. Stratification bykey demographic factors and looking at subsyndrome breakdownson warning and alert days provided the needed information withoutrequiring the use of the detail details.ConclusionsAfter the event, there were three main recommendations forimproving the process.LCPH suggested that the side-by-side visualization of countyand state time series graphs was useful to see trends but the relativescale of the number of visits was unclear due to size and placement(see figure 1). Solutions for future reports include additionalexplanatory text, limiting the report to only county data, and alternativevisualizations that highlight the differences in visit magnitude.As part of the IMT process, the LCPH lead felt that her efforts tophysically go to the Emergency Operations Center to run the reporthelped facilitate communication with partners. However, it is notclear if this effort directly translated into IMT use of the report, whichwas posted to the online event management system and not includedin the daily situation status reports. While LCPH leadership and staffreported anecdotally that they found the report to be very useful,no formal evaluation of use was done with either public health orIMT staff. In advance of the next event, state and county staff shouldprepare evaluation metrics.The report feature in ESSENCE is a bit cumbersome to set up, butit allows for easy production of appealing and customizable reports.This template can be modified for future mass gatherings, includingathletic competitions and county fairs. PHD staff will continueto collaborate with LCPH to repurpose and improve the report foruse in Lane and other counties. Fostering local user comfort withinterpreting ESSENCE data and generating summaries for local useis a priority of the OR ESSENCE team."

Supergene martite-goethite mineralization is hosted within the Marra Mamba Iron Formation and is developed over a strike length of more than 60 km. This multibillion metric ton resource has been drilled out on a 150- × 50- to 50- × 50-m grid, thus providing us with an unprecedented data set for analysis. This study synthesizes the drill hole data and presents a physical process model that can account for the observed distribution of mineralization.A fluid and mass flux model is proposed which envisages a three-stage process: (1) leaching of Fe from banded iron formation (BIF) in the vadose zone by reduced, acidic, meteoric-derived fluids; (2) penetration of an Fe-rich supergene-fluid plume, driven by gravity and focused by bedding-parallel permeability into the body of ambient alkaline groundwater, effecting nonredox, mimetic replacement of magnetite by hematite and of the gangue minerals (carbonate, silicate, and chert) by goethite coupled with the release of silica into the fluid phase; and (3) a change from silica leaching to silica deposition on the downdip margins of the system before the ore-fluid plume is eventually diluted and becomes indistinguishable from the surrounding body of groundwater.Despite the undoubted secondary role played by structurally enhanced permeability, the primary control on ore-fluid hydrology is gravity-driven flow along bedding planes. This central observation explains every observed feature of the three-dimensional distribution of martite-goethite mineralization, and the inherited structural architecture simply provides the context for this process to play out. This type of control is by no means obvious–the ingress of meteoric fluids during later lateritic weathering of the mineralization does not show this control and produces broadly subhorizontal, bedding-discordant zones of overprinting.The fundamental control exerted on the distribution of martite-goethite mineralization by bedding-plane permeability within BIF horizons suggests that the supergene ore-fluid plume created its own porosity via the relevant ore-forming reactions, and that these were in turn controlled by bedding. A corollary of the pseudomorphic replacement process, both the generation of hematite after magnetite and goethite after gangue phases, is that it typically introduces porosity. The mineralizing process thus creates porosity (and potentially permeability) and is likely to be self-propagating as long as there is continuous supply of ore fluid. This putative active porosity-generation process may be an important clue as to the unique conditions of martite-goethite ore formation. Indeed, it may be that the distribution of magnetite is the critical controlling feature of these ore systems, as the nonredox transformation to hematite not only releases Fe2+ to the fluid phase but concurrently introduces porosity. Further research is required to formulate a comprehensive chemical (as opposed to physical) process model for supergene martite-goethite ore formation.Based on the physical process model presented here, the development of a large-scale martite-goethite mineralizing system requires continued delivery of unleached BIF (and, perhaps ultimately, previously mineralized martite-goethite ore) into the vadose zone. The Hamersley Province has been undergoing significant uplift since at least 60 Ma. Preliminary dating of martite-goethite ores from Mining Area C indicates that they formed at about 45 Ma, at a time when the local climate was temperate and wetter than today. The combination of ongoing uplift and a wet, temperate climate is likely to be the key to the widespread formation of martite-goethite deposits in the Hamersley Province."

TPACK-ISTEself-efficacy of vocational and technical teachers was significantly higher than that of the science and mathematicsteachers. While teachers benefit from ICT tools less frequently in measurement and evaluation as well as inpresenting the course subject; in terms of presenting the course subject, high school teachers use ICTs significantlymore often than the secondary school teachers; those who did receive in-service training on the use of technology ineducation use ICTs significantly more often than those who did not receive it.

In this study, seven independent variables were used including normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalised difference moisture index (NDMI), land surface temperature (LST) and terrain factors (DEM, Slope, Aspect). We used root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean error (ME) and determination coefficient (R2) to evaluate the performance of these methods. Validation results showed that performance of the GWRK, GWR, and RK approaches were good with not only low values of root-mean-square error (1.38 kg/m2, 1.48 kg/m2, 0.69 kg/m2), mean error (0.28 kg/m2, -0.22 kg/m2, 0.17 kg/m2) but also high values of R2 (0.76, 0.72, 0.94). The estimated SOC stock values ranged from 0.28-16.26 kg/m2, 0.72–15.24 kg/m2, 0.16–15.83 kg/m2 using GWRK, GWR, RK approaches in the study area. The highest average SOC stock value was in the wetland (6.47 kg/m2, 6.08 kg/m2, 6.44 kg/m2) and the lowest was in cropland (1.63 kg/m2, 1.48 kg/m2, 1.80 kg/m2) using these approaches. According to the validation, GWRK, GWR, and RK approaches produced satisfactory results for estimating and mapping SOC stock. However, Regression Kriging was the best model, followed by GWRK and GWR to predict topsoil organic carbon stock in Tarialan."

Considering this scenario, this work presents an approach that combines Semantic Web technologies and bio-inspired algorithms to perform personalized recommendation of Learning Objects (LOs) using local repositories and Web resources. Web resources are retrieved and structured as LOs, which allows for the automatic generation of metadata, minimizing course tutors' work. Experiments were performed to verify which bio-inspired evolutionary algorithm would be most appropriate in this context. Also, discussions regarding the quality of recommendations considering local repositories and Web have been made. Initial experiments evaluating the efficiency of the proposed approach have shown promising results."

Most commonly, the methods for signal segmentation utilize complex filtering, transformation and feature extraction techniques together with various kinds of classifiers, which especially in the field of biomedical signals, do not perform very well and are generally prone to poor performance when dealing with signals obtained in highly variable environments. In order to address these problems, we designed a new method for the segmentation of heart sound signals using deep convolutional neural networks, which works in a straightforward automatic manner and does not require any complex pre-processing. The proposed method was tested on a set of heartbeat sound clips, collected by non-experts with mobile devices in highly variable environments with excessive background noise. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods, which are taking advantage of using domain knowledge for the analysis of the signals. Based on the encouraging experimental results, we believe that the proposed method can be considered as a solid basis for the further development of the automatic segmentation of highly variable signals using deep neural networks."

These systems rely on the personal preferences of users on items given in the form of ratings and return the preferable items based on choices of like-minded users. In this study, a graph-based recommender system using link prediction techniques incorporating similarity metrics is proposed. A graph-based recommender system that has ratings of users on items can be represented as a bipartite graph, where vertices correspond to users and items and edges to ratings. Recommendation generation in a bipartite graph is a link prediction problem. In current literature, modified link prediction approaches are used to distinguish between fundamental relational dualities of like vs. dislike and similar vs. dissimilar. However, the similarity relationship between users/items is mostly disregarded in the complex domain. The proposed model utilizes user-user and item-item cosine similarity value with the relational dualities in order to improve coverage and hits rate of the system by carefully incorporating similarities. On the standard MovieLens Hetrec and MovieLens datasets, the proposed similarity-inclusive link prediction method performed empirically well compared to other methods operating in the complex domain. The experimental results show that the proposed recommender system can be a plausible alternative to overcome the deficiencies in recommender systems."

Potential consumers often forced to wade through huge amount of reviews to make informed decision. Sentiment analysis has become rapid and effective way to automatically gauge consumers’ opinion. However, such analysis often requires tedious process of manual tagging of large training examples or manually building a lexicon for the purpose of classifying reviews as positive or negative. In this paper, we present a method to automate the tedious process of labeling large textual data in an unsupervised, domain independent and scalable manner. The proposed method combines the lexicon-based and Web-based Point Wise Mutual Information (PMI) statistics to find the Semantic Orientation (SO) of opinion expressed in a review.  Based on proposed methods a system called Domain Independent Automatic Labeling System (DIALS) has been implemented, which takes collection of text from any domain as input and generates fully labeled dataset in an unsupervised and scalable manner. The result generated can be used to track and summarize online discussion and/or use to train any classifier in the next stage of development. The effectiveness of system is tested by comparing it with baseline machine learning and lexicon-based methods. Experiments on multi-domains dataset has shown that proposed method consistently shown improved recall and accuracy as compared to baseline machine learning and lexicon-based methods.   "

Although difficult to achieve from training data alone, it is possible to leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to retain source-language semantic relations in the corresponding target-language translation. The core idea is to use KG entity relations as embedding constraints to improve the mapping from source to target. This paper describes two embedding constraints, both of which employ Entity Linking (EL)---assigning a unique identity to entities---to associate words in training sentences with those in the KG: (1) a monolingual embedding constraint that supports an enhanced semantic representation of the source words through access to relations between entities in a KG; and (2) a bilingual embedding constraint that forces entity relations in the source-language to be carried over to the corresponding entities in the target-language translation. The method is evaluated for English-Spanish translation exploiting Freebase as a source of knowledge. Our experimental results show that exploiting KG information not only decreases the number of unknown words in the translation but also improves translation quality."

This leads to challenges being encountered with some land covers classes, especially in wetlands classes. In this study, satellite images from the Sentinel 2B by ESA (European Space Agency) were used to classify the land cover of Al‑Hawizeh marsh/Iraq‑Iran border. Three classification methods were used aimed at comparing their accuracy, using multispectral satellite images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The classification process was performed using three different algorithms, namely: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification algorithms were carried out using ENVI 5.1 software to detect six land cover classes: deep water marsh, shallow water marsh, marsh vegetation (aquatic vegetation), urban area (built‑up area), agriculture area, and barren soil. The results showed that the MLC method applied to Sentinel 2B images provides a higher overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient compared to the ANN and SVM methods. Overall accuracy values for MLC, ANN, and SVM methods were 85.32%, 70.64%, and 77.01% respectively."

The next an inference method based on weighted path ranking on the knowledge graph is proposed to score the related entities according to the key information and intention of a given question.

With about 1,000 species in the Neotropics, the Eumaeini (Theclinae) are one of the most diverse butterfly tribes. Correct morphology-based identifications are challenging in many genera due to relatively little interspecific differences in wing patterns. Geographic infraspecific variation is sometimes more substantial than variation between species. In this paper we present a large DNA barcode dataset of South American Lycaenidae. We analyze how well DNA barcode BINs match morphologically delimited species.

We compare morphology-based species identifications with the clustering of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) delimitated by the RESL algorithm in BOLD, which assigns Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). We examine intra- and interspecific divergences for genera represented by at least four morphospecies. We discuss the existence of local barcode gaps in a genus by genus analysis.

<jats:title>Results</jats:title>
We identified 2,213 specimens and obtained 1,839 sequences of 512 species in 90 genera. Overall, the mean intraspecific divergence value of CO1 sequences was 1.20%, while the mean interspecific divergence between nearest congeneric neighbors was 4.89%, demonstrating the presence of a barcode gap. However, the gap seemed to disappear from the entire set when comparing the maximum intraspecific distance (8.40%) with the minimum interspecific distance (0.40%). Clear barcode gaps are present in many genera but absent in others. From the set of specimens that yielded COI fragment lengths of at least 650 bp, 75% of the <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> morphology-based identifications were unambiguously assigned to a single Barcode Index Number (BIN). However, after a taxonomic <jats:italic>a posteriori</jats:italic> review, the percentage of matched identifications rose to 85%. BIN splitting was observed for 17% of the species and BIN sharing for 9%. We found that genera that contain primarily lowland species show higher percentages of local barcode gaps and congruence between BINs and morphology than genera that contain exclusively high montane species. The divergence values to the nearest neighbors were significantly lower in high Andean species while the intra-specific divergence values were significantly lower in the lowland species. These results raise questions regarding the causes of observed low inter and high intraspecific genetic variation. We discuss incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization as most likely causes of this phenomenon, as the montane species concerned are relatively young and hybridization is probable. The release of our data set represents an essential baseline for a reference library for biological assessment studies of butterflies in mega diverse countries using modern high-throughput technologies an highlights the necessity of taxonomic revisions for various genera combining both molecular and morphological data.

               <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
               Rodents are among the most notorious invasive alien species worldwide. These invaders have substantially impacted native ecosystems, food production and storage, local infrastructures, human health and well-being. However, the lack of standardized and understandable estimation of their impacts is a serious barrier to raising societal awareness, and hampers effective management interventions at relevant scales.

               <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
               Here, we assessed the economic costs of invasive alien rodents globally in order to help overcome these obstacles. For this purpose, we combined and analysed economic cost data from the <jats:italic>InvaCost</jats:italic> database—the most up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of reported invasion costs—and specific complementary searches within and beyond the published literature.

               <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
               Our conservative analysis showed that reported costs of rodent invasions reached a conservative total of US$ 3.6 billion between 1930 and 2022 (annually US$ 87.5 million between 1980 and 2022), and were significantly increasing through time. The highest cost reported was for muskrat <jats:italic>Ondatra zibethicus</jats:italic> (US$ 377.5 million), then unspecified <jats:italic>Rattus</jats:italic> spp. (US$ 327.8 million), followed by <jats:italic>Rattus norvegicus</jats:italic> specifically (US$ 156.6 million) and <jats:italic>Castor canadensis</jats:italic> (US$ 150.4 million). Of the total costs, 87% were damage-related, principally impacting agriculture and predominantly reported in Asia (60%), Europe (19%) and North America (9%). Our study evidenced obvious cost underreporting with only 99 documents gathered globally, clear taxonomic gaps, reliability issues for cost assessment, and skewed breakdowns of costs among regions, sectors and contexts. As a consequence, these reported costs represent only a very small fraction of the expected true cost of rodent invasions (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, using a less conservative analytic approach would have led to a global amount more than 80-times higher than estimated here).

               <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>
               These findings strongly suggest that available information represents a substantial underestimation of the global costs incurred. We offer recommendations for improving estimates of costs to fill these knowledge gaps including: systematic distinction between native and invasive rodents’ impacts; monetizing indirect impacts on human health; and greater integrative and concerted research effort between scientists and stakeholders. Finally, we discuss why and how this approach will stimulate and provide support for proactive and sustainable management strategies in the context of alien rodent invasions, for which biosecurity measures should be amplified globally.

We document incorporation of<jats:italic>Prunus serotina</jats:italic>(black cherry) into native insect food webs. We find that<jats:italic>P. serotina</jats:italic>harbours a herbivore community less dense but more diverse than its native relative,<jats:italic>P. padus</jats:italic>(bird cherry), with similar proportions of specialists and generalists.

We show that<jats:italic>P. serotina</jats:italic>may have evolved changes in investment in cyanogenic glycosides compared with its native range.

We conclude that evolutionary processes may generate a specialized herbivore community on an invasive plant, allowing prognoses of reduced invasiveness over time. On the basis of the results presented here, we would like to caution that manual control might have the adverse effect of a slowing down of processes of adaptation, and a delay in the decline of the invasive character of<jats:italic>P. serotina</jats:italic>."

The present study is focused on estimating current and simulating future LULC and LST trends in the urban environment of Chaoyang District, Beijing. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method and multispectral Landsat satellite images during the 1990–2018 data period. The cellular automata (CA) and stochastic transition matrix of the Markov model were applied to simulate future (2025) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. The CA model was validated for the simulated and estimated LULC for 1990–2018, with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.83, using validation modules in IDRISI software. Our results indicated that the cumulative changes in built-up to vegetation area were 74.61 km2 (16.08%) and 113.13 km2 (24.38%) from 1990 to 2018. The correlation coefficient of land use and land cover change (LULCC), including vegetation, water bodies and built-up area, had values of<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> =  − 0.155 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.005), −0.809 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.000), and 0.519 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &gt; 0.005), respectively. The results of future analysis revealed that there will be an estimated 164.92 km2 (−12%) decrease in vegetation area, while an expansion of approximately 283.04 km2 (6% change) will occur in built-up areas from 1990 to 2025. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of approximately ∼10.74 °C and ∼12.66 °C in future temperature, which would cause a rise in temperature (2025). The analyses could open an avenue regarding how to manage urban land cover patterns to enhance the resilience of cities to climate warming. This study provides scientific insights for environmental development and sustainability through efficient and effective urban planning and management in Beijing and will also help strengthen other research related to the UHI phenomenon in other parts of the world."

More specifically, it addresses practices of teaching and learning for students with professional experience who work alongside their studies. Based on the assumption that digitalization is a means of allowing more open and flexible pathways for teaching and learning in higher education, the paper focusses on the perspectives and perceptions of both students and teachers in digital supported teaching and learning environments as forms of blended learning. It brings together findings from two qualitative empirical studies: one focused on students’ perspectives of their development over the course of their studies; the second addressed teachers’ perspectives and their teaching strategies and activities. Based on the findings of these two research studies, the paper outlines future perspectives for teaching and learning and the role of digitalization, with a particular emphasis on programs of lifelong learning at universities."

Among experts, there is no clear consensus about the relationships between invasion concepts, and almost no one seems to have a good overview of the literature anymore. Similar observations can be made for other research fields. Science needs new navigation tools so that researchers within and outside of a research field as well as science journalists, students, teachers, practitioners, policy-makers, and others interested in the field can more easily understand its key ideas. Such navigation tools could, for example, be maps of the major concepts and hypotheses of a research field. Applying a bibliometric method, we created such maps for invasion biology. We analysed research papers of the last two decades citing at least two of 35 common invasion hypotheses. Co-citation analysis yields four distinct clusters of hypotheses. These clusters can describe the main directions in invasion biology and explain basic driving forces behind biological invasions. The method we outline here for invasion biology can be easily applied for other research fields."
