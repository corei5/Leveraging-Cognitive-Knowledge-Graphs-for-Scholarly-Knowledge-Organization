5785,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Grassland invader responses to realistic changes in native species richness and abstract: the importance of species richness for repelling exotic plant invasions varies from ecosystem to ecosystem. thus, in order to prioritize conservation objectives, it is critical to identify those ecosystems where decreasing richness will most greatly magnify invasion risks. our goal was to determine if invasion risks greatly increase in response to common reductions in grassland species richness. we imposed treatments that mimic management‐induced reductions in grassland species richness (i.e., removal of shallow‐ and/or deep‐rooted forbs and/or grasses and/or cryptogam layers). then we introduced and monitored the performance of a notorious invasive species (i.e., centaurea maculosa). we found that, on a per‐gram‐of‐biomass basis, each resident plant group similarly suppressed invader growth. hence, with respect to preventing c. maculosa invasions, maintaining overall productivity is probably more important than maintaining the productivity of particular plant groups or species. but at the sites we studied, all plant groups may be needed to maintain overall productivity because removing forbs decreased overall productivity in two of three years. alternatively, removing forbs increased productivity in another year, and this led us to posit that removing forbs may inflate the temporal productivity variance as opposed to greatly affecting time‐averaged productivity. in either case, overall productivity responses to single plant group removals were inconsistent and fairly modest, and only when all plant groups were removed did c. maculosa growth increase substantially over a no‐removal treatment. as such, it seems that intense disturbances (e.g., prolonged drought, overgrazing) that deplete multiple plant groups may often be a prerequisite for c. maculosa invasion.' of a research paper.

11531,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: A DNA barcode library for the butterflies of North America and abstract: although the butterflies of north america have received considerable taxonomic attention, overlooked species and instances of hybridization continue to be revealed. the present study assembles a dna barcode reference library for this fauna to identify groups whose patterns of sequence variation suggest the need for further taxonomic study. based on 14,626 records from 814 species, dna barcodes were obtained for 96% of the fauna. the maximum intraspecific distance averaged 1/4 the minimum distance to the nearest neighbor, producing a barcode gap in 76% of the species. most species (80%) were monophyletic, the others were para- or polyphyletic. although 15% of currently recognized species shared barcodes, the incidence of such taxa was far higher in regions exposed to pleistocene glaciations than in those that were ice-free. nearly 10% of species displayed high intraspecific variation (&gt;2.5%), suggesting the need for further investigation to assess potential cryptic diversity. aside from aiding the identification of all life stages of north american butterflies, the reference library has provided new perspectives on the incidence of both cryptic and potentially over-split species, setting the stage for future studies that can further explore the evolutionary dynamics of this group.' of a research paper.

3359,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Land-Use Land-Cover Classification by Machine Learning Classifiers for Satellite Observations—A Review and abstract: rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover (lulc) change many times. since quantitative assessment of changes in lulc is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for lulc mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. in this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (rf), support vector machine (svm), artificial neural network (ann), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (fuzzy artmap), spectral angle mapper (sam) and mahalanobis distance (md) were examined. accuracy assessment was performed by using kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (roc), index-based validation and root mean square error (rmse). results of kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the rf algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the md algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. in addition, the index-based lulc and visual cross-validation show that the rf algorithm (correlations between rf and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. findings from the literature also proved that ann and rf algorithms are the best lulc classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like sam (kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (auc) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. finally, this review concludes that the rf algorithm is the best machine-learning lulc classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the rf algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.' of a research paper.

1084,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Skills in demand for ICT and statistical occupations: Evidence from web-based job vacancies and abstract: online job portals collecting web vacancies have become important media for job demand and supply matching. they also represent a growing research area for the application of analytical methods to study the labour market using innovative data sources. this paper analyses italian web job vacancies scraped from several types of italian web job portals between june and september 2015. after describing how the occupations associated with each web vacancy (classification up to level 4) were identified and the related skills retrieved in texts using mixed supervised and unsupervised text mining approaches, we focused on job vacancies related to ict and statistical positions.the principal aim of this paper is to describe these jobs in terms of the required skills that have emerged in the labour market from a demand perspective and to identify those skills that best distinguish statisticians from other ict occupations. hence, several machine learning techniques were used to assess those skills that best distinguish occupation codes from other job groups.after quality control and removal of duplications, the scraping collected more than 110,000 job advertisements: nearly 6,200 were classified as ict or statistical positions (largely dominated by software developers). the data indicate that high‐level statisticians have superior and heterogeneous professional backgrounds, linked to theoretical statistics, where analytic skills are more relevant than computing skills. many soft and management‐oriented skills were also called for, which are missing among lower level statisticians, who are restricted to more technical jobs oriented towards general computing and informatics.' of a research paper.

6110,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Future sea level rise constrained by observations and long-term commitment and abstract: significance anthropogenic sea level rise poses challenges to coastal areas worldwide, and robust projections are needed to assess mitigation options and guide adaptation measures. here we present an approach that combines information about the equilibrium sea level response to global warming and last century's observed contribution from the individual components to constrain projections for this century. this “constrained extrapolation” overcomes limitations of earlier global semiempirical estimates because long-term changes in the partitioning of total sea level rise are accounted for. while applying semiempirical methodology, our method yields sea level projections that overlap with the process-based estimates of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. the method can thus lead to a better understanding of the gap between process-based and global semiempirical approaches.' of a research paper.

7553,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Sustainable Teaching Strategies to Teach Indigenous Students: Their Relations to Students’ Engaged Learning and Teachers’ Self-Concept and abstract: to help indigenous australian students engage with academic work, educators and teachers alike need to understand what teaching strategies are beneficial for indigenous students’ learning. this study examines the predictions of the three types of indigenous teaching strategies, namely, integrative teaching (integrating indigenous perspectives in teaching), community linking (utilising indigenous community input), and culture sharing (encouraging indigenous students to share cultural values), to indigenous students’ engaged learning and teachers’ self-concept in teaching. with 208 teachers surveyed from 52 australian urban and rural primary schools, we found that culture sharing had positive contributions to indigenous students’ engaged learning, whereas integrative teaching and community linking positively predicted teachers’ self-concept in indigenous teaching. these differential patterns suggest useful strategies for enhancing student- or teacher-focused outcomes, respectively. how to successfully integrate these indigenous teaching strategies is a key to successful teaching practice, as these strategies cannot only improve indigenous students’ engaged learning but, at the same time, may foster teachers’ confidence in teaching indigenous students.' of a research paper.

11335,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Regional Climate Sensitivity of Climate Extremes in CMIP6 Versus CMIP5 Multimodel Ensembles and abstract: we analyze projected changes in climate extremes (extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation) in the multimodel ensembles of the fifth and sixth coupled model intercomparison projects (cmip5 and cmip6). the results reveal close similarity between both ensembles in the regional climate sensitivity of the projected multimodel mean changes in climate extremes, that is, their projected changes as a function of global warming. this stands in contrast to widely reported divergences in global (transient and equilibrium) climate sensitivity in the two multimodel ensembles. some exceptions include higher warming in the south america monsoon region, lower warming in southern asia and central africa, and higher increases in heavy precipitation in western africa and the sahel region in the cmip6 ensemble. the multimodel spread in regional climate sensitivity is found to be large in both ensembles. in particular, it contributes more to intermodel spread in projected regional climate extremes compared with the intermodel spread in global climate sensitivity in cmip6. our results highlight the need to consider regional climate sensitivity as a distinct feature of earth system models and a key determinant of projected regional impacts, which is largely independent of the models' response in global climate sensitivity.' of a research paper.

6756,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Visual perception of bodily interactions in the primary somatosensory cortex: Touch observation in primary somatosensory cortex and abstract: brain imaging studies in humans have revealed the existence of a visuo‐tactile system, which matches observed touch with felt touch. in this system, the primary somatosensory cortex (si) appears to play a causal role in the visual processing of tactile events. whether this visuo‐tactile mechanism for touch in si applies to the sight of ‘any’ touch, or whether it is restricted to the domain of body‐related tactile experiences remains unresolved. to address this issue, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) was used to determine whether activity in si is strictly related to the visual processing of human body‐part interactions, or is also involved in processing the contact between inanimate objects, or between human body‐parts and objects. the results show that rtms over si selectively impaired the processing of a contralateral visual stimulus depicting a human body‐part being touched by a human agent, while it did not affect the visual perception of contact between objects, or between human body‐parts and objects. correlation analysis shows that this effect was associated with the intensity and embodiment of the observed touched. this result suggests that si is more suited to represent social touch, contributing to our understanding of the effect of interpersonal tactile interactions between people.' of a research paper.

9908,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Identification of Nearctic black flies using DNA barcodes (Diptera: Simuliidae) and abstract: dna barcoding has gained increased recognition as a molecular tool for species identification in various groups of organisms. in this preliminary study, we tested the efficacy of a 615‐bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase i (coi) as a dna barcode in the medically important family simuliidae, or black flies. a total of 65 (25%) morphologically distinct species and sibling species in species complexes of the 255 recognized nearctic black fly species were used to create a preliminary barcode profile for the family. genetic divergence among congeners averaged 14.93% (range 2.83–15.33%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence between morphologically distinct species averaged 0.72% (range 0–3.84%). dna barcodes correctly identified nearly 100% of the morphologically distinct species (87% of the total sampled taxa), whereas in species complexes (13% of the sampled taxa) maximum values of divergence were comparatively higher (max. 4.58–6.5%), indicating cryptic diversity. the existence of sibling species in prosimulium travisi and p. neomacropyga was also demonstrated, thus confirming previous cytological evidence about the existence of such cryptic diversity in these two taxa. we conclude that dna barcoding is an effective method for species identification and discovery of cryptic diversity in black flies.' of a research paper.

9021,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Perennial forage legume cultivation and their above-ground mass management methods for weed suppression in arable organic cropping systems and abstract: abstractbackgroundin organic crop farms, growing crop yields are limited by insufficient nitrogen supply to plants and crop weediness. in such farms, legume swards are proposed as a service crop to improve nitrogen cycling. however, a positive effect of nitrogen is not only on cereals but also on weeds. in crop rotation, legume swards can stimulate the competition of cereals using the above-ground mass of legume to control the spread of weeds.the effects of the following methods for weeds control were analyzed: (i) forage legumes (trifolium pratensel. andt. repens) undersown in cereals, (ii) forage legumes (t. pratense l., medicago satival.) and their mixture with festulolium (x festuliolium) and their above-ground mass management methods, and (iii) plant-based fertilizers (red clover above-ground mass fermented and composted).resultsoat with red clover undersown reduced weediness more than red clover monocrops, pea, and their mixture with oats. incorporated undersown white clover mass increased spring barley competitiveness with weeds. when growing legume swards for a longer period of time (green fallow), red clover and their mixture with festulolium are the most suitable for this purpose. the lowest weed dry weight (average 34%, compared with the removal from the field) was obtained while using the mixed management. the cultivation of cereals after forage legumes and their mixtures with festulolium (as a preceding crop) increases its grain yield and competitive ability against weeds. fermented red clover and fermented pea and spring wheat mixture mass, as a manure, did not increase weediness.conclusionsit was concluded that the effectiveness of the perennial forage legumes is determined by the uses of the above-ground mass: soil cover, mulching, application of green manure, and intensity of mass mineralization. type of activity of forage legumes on weeds were competition for environmental resources, disruption/promotion of germination, destruction of above-ground mass, reduction of the amount of matured seeds, creation of a physical barrier (mulch), and increase of competitiveness of cereals. growing forage legumes in pure crops usually leads to a loss of marketable production.graphic abstract' of a research paper.

8552,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Please Get to the Point! A Cortical Correlate of Linguistic Informativeness and abstract: the production of informative messages is an effortful endeavor that relies on the interaction between microlinguistic (i.e., lexical and grammatical) and macrolinguistic (i.e., pragmatic and discourse) levels of processing. although the neural correlates of microlinguistic processing have been extensively studied, investigation of the ability to organize the macrolinguistic aspects of message production is scanty. in this article, we show that repetitive tms of the dorsal portion of the anterior left, but not right, inferior frontal gyrus reduces the levels of lexical informativeness and global coherence of narratives produced by healthy individuals. interestingly, levels of productivity and microlinguistic processing were unaffected by the stimulation. these results suggest that the dorsal aspect of the anterior left inferior frontal gyrus is an epicenter of a wider neural network subserving the selection of contextually appropriate semantic representations.' of a research paper.

2712,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Economic costs of invasive rodents worldwide: the tip of the iceberg and abstract: background rodents are among the most notorious invasive alien species worldwide. these invaders have substantially impacted native ecosystems, food production and storage, local infrastructures, human health and well-being. however, the lack of standardized and understandable estimation of their impacts is a serious barrier to raising societal awareness, and hampers effective management interventions at relevant scales. methods here, we assessed the economic costs of invasive alien rodents globally in order to help overcome these obstacles. for this purpose, we combined and analysed economic cost data from the invacost database—the most up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of reported invasion costs—and specific complementary searches within and beyond the published literature. results our conservative analysis showed that reported costs of rodent invasions reached a conservative total of us$ 3.6 billion between 1930 and 2022 (annually us$ 87.5 million between 1980 and 2022), and were significantly increasing through time. the highest cost reported was for muskrat ondatra zibethicus (us$ 377.5 million), then unspecified rattus spp. (us$ 327.8 million), followed by rattus norvegicus specifically (us$ 156.6 million) and castor canadensis (us$ 150.4 million). of the total costs, 87% were damage-related, principally impacting agriculture and predominantly reported in asia (60%), europe (19%) and north america (9%). our study evidenced obvious cost underreporting with only 99 documents gathered globally, clear taxonomic gaps, reliability issues for cost assessment, and skewed breakdowns of costs among regions, sectors and contexts. as a consequence, these reported costs represent only a very small fraction of the expected true cost of rodent invasions (e.g., using a less conservative analytic approach would have led to a global amount more than 80-times higher than estimated here). conclusions these findings strongly suggest that available information represents a substantial underestimation of the global costs incurred. we offer recommendations for improving estimates of costs to fill these knowledge gaps including: systematic distinction between native and invasive rodents’ impacts; monetizing indirect impacts on human health; and greater integrative and concerted research effort between scientists and stakeholders. finally, we discuss why and how this approach will stimulate and provide support for proactive and sustainable management strategies in the context of alien rodent invasions, for which biosecurity measures should be amplified globally.' of a research paper.

6583,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Scalable One-Step Wet-Spinning of Graphene Fibers and Yarns from Liquid Crystalline Dispersions of Graphene Oxide: Towards Multifunctional Textiles and abstract: key points in the formation of liquid crystalline (lc) dispersions of graphene oxide (go) and their processability via wet‐spinning to produce long lengths of micrometer‐dimensional fibers and yarns are addressed. based on rheological and polarized optical microscopy investigations, a rational relation between go sheet size and polydispersity, concentration, liquid crystallinity, and spinnability is proposed, leading to an understanding of lyotropic lc behavior and fiber spinnability. the knowledge gained from the straightforward formulation of lc go “inks” in a range of processable concentrations enables the spinning of continuous conducting, strong, and robust fibers at concentrations as low as 0.075 wt%, eliminating the need for relatively concentrated spinning dope dispersions. the dilute lc go dispersion is proven to be suitable for fiber spinning using a number of coagulation strategies, including non‐solvent precipitation, dispersion destabilization, ionic cross‐linking, and polyelectrolyte complexation. one‐step continuous spinning of graphene fibers and yarns is introduced for the first time by in situ spinning of lc go in basic coagulation baths (i.e., naoh or koh), eliminating the need for post‐treatment processes. the thermal conductivity of these graphene fibers is found to be much higher than polycrystalline graphite and other types of 3d carbon based materials.' of a research paper.

6255,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Predictions of kelp distribution shifts along the northern coast of Japan and abstract: japanese kelps are important because they perform a valuable ecosystem function of coastal kelp forest formation, and they are important food resources. the present study aimed to predict future shifts in major kelp species in northern japan under different climate change scenarios. from a database of cold temperate kelp species in japan, we extracted 1,958 data points to estimate the distribution of 11 kelp species that inhabit the waters around northern japan. distributions of the past (1980s) and the future (2040s and 2090s) were estimated using a species distribution model (maxent). variation in summer and winter sea surface temperatures was the factor most responsible for the estimated distribution patterns for most species; the length of natural rocky coasts and wave height were also important for some species. a forecast of shifts in distributions based on different intergovernmental panel on climate change scenarios showed that kelp species diversity in japan would significantly decrease. by the 2090s, their habitat range overall was estimated to decline to 30–51% of that of the 1980s with moderate warming (representative concentration pathways [rcp] 4.5) and to 0–25% with severe warming (rcp 8.5). the model predicted that 6 of 11 cold temperate kelp species may become extinct around japan by the 2090s (rcp 8.5). commercially important species, such as saccharina japonica, are also expected to decline greatly, which may affect kelp fisheries and aquaculture in northern japan.' of a research paper.

3610,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Short-Term Effects of Tillage Systems, Fertilization, and Cropping Patterns on Soil Chemical Properties and Maize Yields in a Loamy Sand Soil in Southern Mozambique and abstract: sub-saharan africa (ssa) agriculture is characterized by dependence on erratic rainfall, inadequate conservation practices, and a decline in soil fertility resulting in low crop productivity. therefore, conservation agriculture (ca) has been proposed as an alternative to improve soil fertility and productivity. hence the aim was to investigate the effects of tillage systems, fertilization, and cropping patterns on selected soil chemical properties (ph, organic carbon, total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity) and identify which cropping pattern maximizes stover and grain maize–legume productivity and land use. a two-year (2016/17–2017/18) field experiment in a loamy sand soil was conducted at nhacoongo research station, southern mozambique. two tillage systems (conservation (ca) and conventional tillage (ct)), two fertilization treatments (fertilized and unfertilized), and seven cropping patterns (four sole crops and three maize–legume intercrops) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with split–split plot arrangement and replicated four times. ca practices resulted in significantly higher soil chemical properties and increased stover and grain yields as compared to ct practices, but fertilization demonstrated insignificant effects on soil chemical properties and significant influences on stover and grain yield of maize and legumes. cropping patterns induced no significant effect on soil chemical properties and either stover or grain yield. estimated indices like land equivalent ratio (1.18–2.67) and competitive ratio index (0.01–1.72) confirmed the advantage of intercropping against sole cropping. this is largely supported by the estimated values of aggressivity and relative crowding coefficient. smallholder farmers can therefore benefit by adopting ca.' of a research paper.

5153,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Costume in the dance archive: Towards a records-centred ethics of care and abstract: focusing on the archival records of the production and performance of dance in trees and church by the swedish independent dance group rubicon, this article conceptualizes a records-oriented costume ethics. theorizations of costume as a co-creative agent of performance are brought into the dance archive to highlight the productivity of paying attention to costume in the making of performance history. addressing recent developments within archival studies, a feminist ethics of care and radical empathy is employed, which is the capability to empathically engage with others, even if it can be difficult, as a means of exploring how a records-centred costume ethics can be conceptualized for the dance archive. the exploration resulted in two ethical stances useful for better attending to costume-bodies in the dance archive: (1) caring for costume-body relations in the dance archive means that a conventional, so-called static understanding of records as neutral carriers of facts is replaced by a more inclusive, expanding and infinite process. by moving across time and space, and with a caring attitude finding and exploring fragments from various, sometimes contradictory production processes, one can help scattered and poorly represented dance and costume histories to emerge and contribute to the formation of identity and memory. (2) the use of bodily empathy with records can respectfully bring together the understanding of costume in performance as inseparable from the performer’s body with dance as an art form that explicitly uses the dancing costume-body as an expressive tool. it is argued that bodily empathy with records in the dance archive helps one access bodily holisms that create possibilities for exploring the potential of art to critically expose and render strange ideological systems and normativities.' of a research paper.

6769,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Alien plants can be associated with a decrease in local and regional native richness even when at low abundance and abstract: the impacts of alien plants on native richness are usually assessed at small spatial scales and in locations where the alien is at high abundance. but this raises two questions: to what extent do impacts occur where alien species are at low abundance, and do local impacts translate to effects at the landscape scale? in an analysis of 47 widespread alien plant species occurring across a 1,000 km2 landscape, we examined the relationship between their local abundance and native plant species richness in 594 grassland plots. we first defined the critical abundance at which these focal alien species were associated with a decline in native α‐richness (plot‐scale species numbers), and then assessed how this local decline was translated into declines in native species γ‐richness (landscape‐scale species numbers). after controlling for sampling biases and environmental gradients that might lead to spurious relationships, we found that eight out of 47 focal alien species were associated with a significant decline in native α‐richness as their local abundance increased. most of these significant declines started at low to intermediate classes of abundance. for these eight species, declines in native γ‐richness were, on average, an order of magnitude (32.0 vs. 2.2 species) greater than those found for native α‐richness, mostly due to spatial homogenization of native communities. the magnitude of the decrease at the landscape scale was best explained by the number of plots where an alien species was found above its critical abundance. synthesis. even at low abundance, alien plants may impact native plant richness at both local and landscape scales. local impacts may result in much greater declines in native richness at larger spatial scales. quantifying impact at the landscape scale requires consideration of not only the prevalence of an alien plant, but also its critical abundance and its effect on native community homogenization. this suggests that management approaches targeting only those locations dominated by alien plants might not mitigate impacts effectively. our integrated approach will improve the ranking of alien species risks at a spatial scale appropriate for prioritizing management and designing conservation policies.' of a research paper.

5445,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Emergent constraints on transient climate response  (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from historical warming in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models and abstract: abstract. climate sensitivity to co2 remains the key uncertainty in projections of future climate change. transient climate response (tcr) is the metric of temperature sensitivity that is most relevant to warming in the next few decades and contributes the biggest uncertainty to estimates of the carbon budgets consistent with the paris targets. equilibrium climate sensitivity (ecs) is vital for understanding longer-term climate change and stabilisation targets. in the ipcc 5th assessment report (ar5), the stated “likely” ranges (16 %–84 % confidence) of tcr (1.0–2.5 k) and ecs (1.5–4.5 k) were broadly consistent with the ensemble of cmip5 earth system models (esms) available at the time. however, many of the latest cmip6 esms have larger climate sensitivities, with 5 of 34 models having tcr values above 2.5 k and an ensemble mean tcr of 2.0±0.4 k. even starker, 12 of 34 models have an ecs value above 4.5 k. on the face of it, these latest esm results suggest that the ipcc likely ranges may need revising upwards, which would cast further doubt on the feasibility of the paris targets. here we show that rather than increasing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the cmip6 models help to constrain the likely range of tcr to 1.3–2.1 k, with a central estimate of 1.68 k. we reach this conclusion through an emergent constraint approach which relates the value of tcr linearly to the global warming from 1975 onwards. this is a period when the signal-to-noise ratio of the net radiative forcing increases strongly, so that uncertainties in aerosol forcing become progressively less problematic. we find a consistent emergent constraint on tcr when we apply the same method to cmip5 models. our constraints on tcr are in good agreement with other recent studies which analysed cmip ensembles. the relationship between ecs and the post-1975 warming trend is less direct and also non-linear. however, we are able to derive a likely range of ecs of 1.9–3.4 k from the cmip6 models by assuming an underlying emergent relationship based on a two-box energy balance model. despite some methodological differences; this is consistent with a previously published ecs constraint derived from warming trends in cmip5 models to 2005. our results seem to be part of a growing consensus amongst studies that have applied the emergent constraint approach to different model ensembles and to different aspects of the record of global warming.' of a research paper.

12284,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Broad anti-coronaviral activity of FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and SARS-CoV in vivo and abstract: sars-cov-2 emerged in china at the end of 2019 and has rapidly become a pandemic with roughly 2.7 million recorded covid-19 cases and greater than 189,000 recorded deaths by april 23rd, 2020 (www.who.org). there are no fda approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including sars-cov-2. current treatments for covid-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of fda approved drugs. rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. a quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in covid-19 patients. here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 that also inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov. we found that 17 of these inhibit sars-cov-2 at a range of ic50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. we directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious sars-cov-2 production. moreover, we have evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted sars-cov model and found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.' of a research paper.

10472,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Resistance of Native Plant Functional Groups to Invasion by Medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) and abstract: understanding the relative importance of various functional groups in minimizing invasion by medusahead is central to increasing the resistance of native plant communities. the objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of key functional groups within an intact wyoming big sagebrush–bluebunch wheatgrass community type on minimizing medusahead invasion. treatments consisted of removal of seven functional groups at each of two sites, one with shrubs and one without shrubs. removal treatments included (1) everything, (2) shrubs, (3) perennial grasses, (4) taprooted forbs, (5) rhizomatous forbs, (6) annual forbs, and (7) mosses. a control where nothing was removed was also established. plots were arranged in a randomized complete block with 4 replications (blocks) at each site. functional groups were removed beginning in the spring of 2004 and maintained monthly throughout each growing season through 2009. medusahead was seeded at a rate of 2,000 seeds m−2 (186 seeds ft−2) in fall 2005. removing perennial grasses nearly doubled medusahead density and biomass compared with any other removal treatment. the second highest density and biomass of medusahead occurred from removing rhizomatous forbs (phlox). we found perennial grasses played a relatively more significant role than other species in minimizing invasion by medusahead. we suggest that the most effective basis for establishing medusahead-resistant plant communities is to establish 2 or 3 highly productive grasses that are complementary in niche and that overlap that of the invading species.' of a research paper.

3397,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Weak Supervision for Fake News Detection via Reinforcement Learning and abstract: today social media has become the primary source for news. via social media platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and put users and communities at great risk. therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. however, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. therefore, how to obtain fresh and high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection. in order to tackle this challenge, we propose a reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., wefend, which can leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection. the proposed framework consists of three main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news detector. the annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news based on users' reports. the reinforced selector using reinforcement learning techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction performance. the fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the news content. we tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news articles published via wechat official accounts and associated user reports. extensive experiments on this dataset show that the proposed wefend model achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.' of a research paper.

10934,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Farm production, market access and dietary diversity in Malawi and abstract: abstractobjectivethe association between farm production diversity and dietary diversity in rural smallholder households was recently analysed. most existing studies build on household-level dietary diversity indicators calculated from 7d food consumption recalls. herein, this association is revisited with individual-level 24 h recall data. the robustness of the results is tested by comparing household- and individual-level estimates. the role of other factors that may influence dietary diversity, such as market access and agricultural technology, is also analysed.designa survey of smallholder farm households was carried out in malawi in 2014. dietary diversity scores are calculated from 24 h recall data. production diversity scores are calculated from farm production data covering a period of 12 months. individual- and household-level regression models are developed and estimated.settingdata were collected in sixteen districts of central and southern malawi.subjectssmallholder farm households (n408), young children (n519) and mothers (n408).resultsfarm production diversity is positively associated with dietary diversity. however, the estimated effects are small. access to markets for buying food and selling farm produce and use of chemical fertilizers are shown to be more important for dietary diversity than diverse farm production. results with household- and individual-level dietary data are very similar.conclusionsfurther increasing production diversity may not be the most effective strategy to improve diets in smallholder farm households. improving access to markets, productivity-enhancing inputs and technologies seems to be more promising.' of a research paper.

6249,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Overview of BioCreAtIvE: critical assessment of information extraction for biology and abstract: abstract background the goal of the first biocreative challenge (critical assessment of information extraction in biology) was to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for text mining applied to biological problems. the results were presented in a workshop held in granada, spain march 28–31, 2004. the articles collected in this bmc bioinformatics supplement entitled ""a critical assessment of text mining methods in molecular biology"" describe the biocreative tasks, systems, results and their independent evaluation. results biocreative focused on two tasks. the first dealt with extraction of gene or protein names from text, and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism databases (fly, mouse, yeast). the second task addressed issues of functional annotation, requiring systems to identify specific text passages that supported gene ontology annotations for specific proteins, given full text articles. conclusion the first biocreative assessment achieved a high level of international participation (27 groups from 10 countries). the assessment provided state-of-the-art performance results for a basic task (gene name finding and normalization), where the best systems achieved a balanced 80% precision / recall or better, which potentially makes them suitable for real applications in biology. the results for the advanced task (functional annotation from free text) were significantly lower, demonstrating the current limitations of text-mining approaches where knowledge extrapolation and interpretation are required. in addition, an important contribution of biocreative has been the creation and release of training and test data sets for both tasks. there are 22 articles in this special issue, including six that provide analyses of results or data quality for the data sets, including a novel inter-annotator consistency assessment for the test set used in task 2.' of a research paper.

4004,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Onto2vec: joint vector-based representation of biological entities and their ontology-based annotations and abstract: abstract motivation biological knowledge is widely represented in the form of ontology-based annotations: ontologies describe the phenomena assumed to exist within a domain, and the annotations associate a (kind of) biological entity with a set of phenomena within the domain. the structure and information contained in ontologies and their annotations make them valuable for developing machine learning, data analysis and knowledge extraction algorithms; notably, semantic similarity is widely used to identify relations between biological entities, and ontology-based annotations are frequently used as features in machine learning applications. results we propose the onto2vec method, an approach to learn feature vectors for biological entities based on their annotations to biomedical ontologies. our method can be applied to a wide range of bioinformatics research problems such as similarity-based prediction of interactions between proteins, classification of interaction types using supervised learning, or clustering. to evaluate onto2vec, we use the gene ontology (go) and jointly produce dense vector representations of proteins, the go classes to which they are annotated, and the axioms in go that constrain these classes. first, we demonstrate that onto2vec-generated feature vectors can significantly improve prediction of protein–protein interactions in human and yeast. we then illustrate how onto2vec representations provide the means for constructing data-driven, trainable semantic similarity measures that can be used to identify particular relations between proteins. finally, we use an unsupervised clustering approach to identify protein families based on their enzyme commission numbers. our results demonstrate that onto2vec can generate high quality feature vectors from biological entities and ontologies. onto2vec has the potential to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in several predictive applications in which ontologies are involved. availability and implementation https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/onto2vec supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.' of a research paper.

8269,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Remember your roots: Biogeographic properties of plants' native habitats can inform invasive plant risk assessments and abstract: abstractaimreducing the effects of invasive plants is best accomplished by predicting which species will invade and preventing their introduction. to do this, risk assessments rely on a variety of plant traits and biogeographic properties to predict potential invasiveness. however, the relative importance of these traits and properties is unknown. determining which biogeographic properties contribute the most to predicting invasiveness could improve the accuracy and reduce the time needed to complete future risk assessments. here, we provide a comprehensive analysis and ranking of the biogeographic properties that best differentiate invasive and noninvasive plant species.locationconterminous united states.methodswe compiled county‐level distributions of 10,721 vascular plant species native to the conterminous united states of which 884 were established elsewhere and 131 were invasive elsewhere. for each species, we used native distribution data to calculate biogeographic properties, including range size, human modification and abiotic niche breadth. we assessed the ability of biogeographic properties to predict whether each species was invasive outside of the united states using random forest classification models.resultsvariables that represent the breadth of a species' native range, including the ranges of soil textures, ranges of soil fertility and total geographic area, are strong predictors of plant invasiveness. models that included these variables correctly classified 86% of invasive species and 62% of noninvasive species. variables representing resource availability and disturbance regime were not useful for distinguishing between established and invasive species.main conclusionsfocusing on niche breadth properties could improve the accuracy of risk assessments and reduce the effort spent compiling information with lower predictive power. the importance of niche breadth in this analysis supports previous findings that broad physiological tolerance enables survival and reproduction in numerous environments, thereby increasing the likelihood of invasion.' of a research paper.

8313,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Human cortical theta reactivity to high‐frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and abstract: electroencephalography (eeg) can directly monitor the temporal progression of cortical changes induced by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) and facilitate the understanding of cortical and subcortical influences in the genesis of oscillations. in this combined rtms/eeg study, we aimed to investigate changes in oscillatory activity after high‐frequency (∼11 hz) rtms relative to the number of applied pulses. twenty intermittent trains of 20 or 60 rtms pulses were delivered over the human primary motor cortex at rest and tuned to individual mu frequency. the regional and interregional oscillatory neural activity after stimulation were evaluated using event‐related power (erpow) and event‐related coherence (ercoh) transformations. the most prominent changes for erpow were observed in the theta band (4–7 hz), as an increase in erpow up to 20 s following 60 rtms pulses, whereas erpow increases were smaller in mu (10–12 hz) and beta (13–30 hz). ercoh revealed that rtms 60 modulated the connectivity in the theta band for up to 20 s. the topography of mu and theta changes were not identical; mu was more focal and theta was more global. our data suggested the presence of independent cortical theta and mu generators with different reactivity to rtms but could not rule out possible thalamocortical contributions in generating theta and mu over the motor network. hum brain mapp 33:2224–2237, 2012. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.' of a research paper.

4373,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: A DNA barcode library for 5,200 German flies and midges (Insecta: Diptera) and its implications for metabarcoding‐based biomonitoring and abstract: this study summarizes results of a dna barcoding campaign on german diptera, involving analysis of 45,040 specimens. the resultant dna barcode library includes records for 2,453 named species comprising a total of 5,200 barcode index numbers (bins), including 2,700 coi haplotype clusters without species‐level assignment, so called “dark taxa.” overall, 88 out of 117 families (75%) recorded from germany were covered, representing more than 50% of the 9,544 known species of german diptera. until now, most of these families, especially the most diverse, have been taxonomically inaccessible. by contrast, within a few years this study provided an intermediate taxonomic system for half of the german dipteran fauna, which will provide a useful foundation for subsequent detailed, integrative taxonomic studies. using dna extracts derived from bulk collections made by malaise traps, we further demonstrate that species delineation using bins and operational taxonomic units (otus) constitutes an effective method for biodiversity studies using dna metabarcoding. as the reference libraries continue to grow, and gaps in the species catalogue are filled, bin lists assembled by metabarcoding will provide greater taxonomic resolution. the present study has three main goals: (a) to provide a dna barcode library for 5,200 bins of diptera; (b) to demonstrate, based on the example of bulk extractions from a malaise trap experiment, that dna barcode clusters, labelled with globally unique identifiers (such as otus and/or bins), provide a pragmatic, accurate solution to the “taxonomic impediment”; and (c) to demonstrate that interim names based on bins and otus obtained through metabarcoding provide an effective method for studies on species‐rich groups that are usually neglected in biodiversity research projects because of their unresolved taxonomy.' of a research paper.

3713,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: A Short Text Similarity Calculation Method Combining Semantic and Headword Attention Mechanism and abstract: short text similarity computation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks. siamese neural networks are widely used in short text similarity calculation. however, due to the complexity of syntax and the correlation between words, siamese networks alone cannot achieve satisfactory results. many studies show that the use of an attention mechanism will improve the impact of key features that can be utilized to measure sentence similarity. in this paper, a similarity calculation method is proposed which combines semantics and a headword attention mechanism. first, a bigru model is utilized to extract contextual information. after obtaining the headword set, the semantically enhanced representations of the two sentences are obtained through an attention mechanism and character splicing. finally, we use a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to fuse the word embedding information with the contextual information. the experimental results on the atec and msrp datasets show that the recall and f1 values of the proposed model are significantly improved through the introduction of the headword attention mechanism.' of a research paper.

11467,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: DNA barcodes reveal cryptic genetic diversity within the blackfly subgenus Trichodagmia Enderlein (Diptera: Simuliidae: Simulium) and related taxa in the New World and abstract: in this paper we investigate the utility of the coi dna barcoding region for species identification and for revealing hidden diversity within the subgenus trichodagmia and related taxa in the new world. in total, 24 morphospecies within the current expanded taxonomic concept of trichodagmia were analyzed. three species in the subgenus aspathia and 10 species in the subgenus simulium s.str. were also included in the analysis because of their putative phylogenetic relationship with trichodagmia. in the neighbour joining analysis tree (nj) derived from the dna barcodes most of the specimens grouped together according to species or species groups as recognized by other morphotaxonomic studies. the interspecific genetic divergence averaged 11.2% (range 2.8–19.5%), whereas intraspecific genetic divergence within morphologically distinct species averaged 0.5% (range 0–1.2%). higher values of genetic divergence (3.2–3.7%) in species complexes suggest the presence of cryptic diversity. the existence of well defined groups within s. piperi, s. duodenicornium, s. canadense and s. rostratum indicate the possible presence of cryptic species within these taxa. also, the suspected presence of a sibling species in s. tarsatum and s. paynei is supported. dna barcodes also showed that specimens from species that were taxonomically difficult to delimit such as s. hippovorum, s. rubrithorax, s. paynei, and other related taxa (s. solarii), grouped together in the nj analysis, confirming the validity of their species status. the recovery of partial barcodes from specimens in collections was time consuming and pcr success was low from specimens more than 10 years old. however, when a sequence was obtained, it provided good resolution for species identification. larvae preserved in ‘weak’ carnoy’s solution (9:1 ethanol:acetic acid) provided full dna barcodes. adding legs directly to the pcr mix from recently collected and preserved adults was an inexpensive, fast methodology to obtain full barcodes. in summary, dna barcoding combined with a sound morphotaxonomic framework provides an effective approach for the delineation of species and for the discovery of hidden diversity in the subgenus trichodagmia.' of a research paper.

382,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Mapping the chlorophyll‐a concentrations in hypereutrophic Krishnagiri Reservoir (India) using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and abstract: krishnagiri reservoir exhibits a hypereutrophic status and continuously receives external sediment and nutrient loads, in addition to its internal phosphorus loading, both affecting the reservoir water quality. increased nutrient loading attributable to changing anthropogenic activities in the catchment area will further exacerbate the deteriorating trophic status. temporal satellite imageries can play a crucial role in the rapid assessment of the trophic status of the reservoir over a large spatial extent. the eutrophication status of freshwater systems is directly related to the chlorophyll‐a (chl‐a) concentration, which represents a major trophic state indicator by reflecting green and absorbing violet‐blue and orange‐red light of the solar energy spectrum. the present study was undertaken to map seasonal chl‐a concentration variations using landsat 8 operational land imager (oli) images. multiple regression equations developed using reflectance in the green, near infrared, shortwave infrared 1 and 2 and coastal bands (r2 = .635) were found to be the best fit of the model in mapping the chl‐a concentration variations in krishnagiri reservoir. the derived regression model also can be used to determine the trophic state of the reservoir and can facilitate a more rapid assessment for developing management strategies for sustainable reservoir water quality management.' of a research paper.

10500,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon Using Sentinel Series Data: A Case Study of the Ebinur Lake Watershed in Xinjiang and abstract: as an important evaluation index of soil quality, soil organic carbon (soc) plays an important role in soil health, ecological security, soil material cycle and global climate cycle. the use of multi-source remote sensing on soil organic carbon distribution has a certain auxiliary effect on the study of soil organic carbon storage and the regional ecological cycle. however, the study on soc distribution in ebinur lake basin in arid and semi-arid regions is limited to the mapping of measured data, and the soil mapping of soc using remote sensing data needs to be studied. whether different machine learning methods can improve prediction accuracy in mapping process is less studied in arid areas. based on that, combined with the proposed problems, this study selected the typical area of the ebinur lake basin in the arid region as the study area, took the sentinel data as the main data source, and used the sentinel-1a (radar data), the sentinel-2a and the sentinel-3a (multispectral data), combined with 16 kinds of dem derivatives and climate data (annual average temperature mat, annual average precipitation map) as analysis. the five different types of data are reconstructed by spatial data and divided into four spatial resolutions (10, 100, 300, and 500 m). seven models are constructed and predicted by machine learning methods rf and cubist. the results show that the prediction accuracy of rf model is better than that of cubist model, indicating that rf model is more suitable for small areas in arid areas. among the three data sources, sentinel-1a has the highest soc prediction accuracy of 0.391 at 10 m resolution under the rf model. the results of the importance of environmental variables show that the importance of flow accumulation is higher in the rf model and the importance of slop in the dem derivative is higher in the cubist model. in the prediction results, soc is mainly distributed in oasis and regions with more human activities, while soc is less distributed in other regions. this study provides a certain reference value for the prediction of small-scale soil organic carbon spatial distribution by means of remote sensing and environmental factors.' of a research paper.

4353,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Distribution of an alien aquatic snail in relation to flow variability, human activities and water quality and abstract: summary 1. disturbance and anthropogenic land use changes are usually considered to be key factors facilitating biological invasions. however, specific comparisons of invasion success between sites affected to different degrees by these factors are rare. 2. in this study we related the large‐scale distribution of the invading new zealand mud snail (potamopyrgus antipodarum) in southern victorian streams, australia, to anthropogenic land use, flow variability, water quality and distance from the site to the sea along the stream channel. 3. the presence of p. antipodarum was positively related to an index of flow‐driven disturbance, the coefficient of variability of mean daily flows for the year prior to the study. 4. furthermore, we found that the invader was more likely to occur at sites with multiple land uses in the catchment, in the forms of grazing, forestry and anthropogenic developments (e.g. towns and dams), compared with sites with low‐impact activities in the catchment. however, this relationship was confounded by a higher likelihood of finding this snail in lowland sites close to the sea. 5. we conclude that p. antipodarum could potentially be found worldwide at sites with similar ecological characteristics. we hypothesise that its success as an invader may be related to an ability to quickly re‐colonise denuded areas and that population abundances may respond to increased food resources. disturbances could facilitate this invader by creating spaces for colonisation (e.g. a possible consequence of floods) or changing resource levels (e.g. increased nutrient levels in streams with intense human land use in their catchments).' of a research paper.

6004,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Recovery of insular seabird populations years after rodent eradication and abstract: seabirds have been particularly affected by invasive non‐native species, which has led to the implementation of numerous eradication campaigns for the conservation of these keystone and highly vulnerable species. although the benefits of eradication of invasive non‐native species for seabird conservation have been demonstrated, the recovery kinetics of different seabird populations on islands after eradication remains poorly evaluated. we conducted long‐term monitoring of the number of breeding pairs of seven seabird species on a small atoll, surprise island, new caledonia (southwestern tropical pacific). marine avifauna of the island were surveyed yearly 4 years before to 4 years after rodent eradication (conducted in 2005), and we conducted multiple one‐time surveys from ∼10 years before and ∼15 years after eradication. we sought to determine how different seabird species responded to the eradication of invasive rodents in an insular environment. three species responded positively (two‐ to 10‐fold increase in population size) to eradication with differences in lag time and sensitivity. the number of breeding pairs increased (effect sizes = 0.49–0.95 and 0.35–0.52) for two species over 4 years post‐eradication due to immigration. one species had a longer (at least 5 years) response time than all others; breeding pairs increased for over 10 years after eradication. long‐term sampling was necessary to observe the responses of the seabird populations on the island because of the delayed response of a species to eradication not visible in the first years after eradication. our results confirmed the positive effects of eradication of invasive non‐native species on seabirds and emphasize the importance of mid‐ and long‐term pre‐ and posteradication surveys to decipher the mechanisms of seabird recovery and confirm the benefits of eradication for conservation purposes.' of a research paper.

7784,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Spatial relationship between land-use/land-cover change and land surface temperature in the Dongting Lake area, China and abstract: the dongting lake area (china) is a climate change-sensitive and ecologically fragile area and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the regional climate. in recent decades, rapid social and economic development has led to increased land use/land cover (lulc) changes in the dongting lake area, which affect the surface energy balance and hydrological processes. its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. therefore, we retrieved the land surface temperature (lst) from the landsat 7 data and explored its relationship with the lulc types. the results showed that lst is significantly affected by surface type. lst varied significantly across lulc types, with higher lsts in built-up land, reed beach land, forest land, and paddy fields than in water bodies, mud beaches, marshlands, and riparian forests. water bodies play an important regulatory role in reducing lst and mitigating thermal effects on the ground. the winter lst in the study area increased by approximately 3.5 °c, which may be related to the decrease in the area of dongting lake water bodies, water fields and reed flats after the three gorges reservoir was impounded. compared with the relationship between the ndvi, dem, and distance from the water body, the negative correlation between the ndmi and lst was stronger and more stable and had the greatest effect on lst. these insights improve the understanding of the land change consequences on the temporal dynamics of lst.' of a research paper.

8903,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Modifying the Cortical Processing for Motor Preparation by Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and abstract: abstract to investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) on the central processing of motor preparation, we had subjects perform a precued-choice reaction time (rt) task. they had to press one of two buttons as quickly as possible after a go signal specifying both the hand to be used and the button to press. a precue preceding this signal conveyed full, partial, or no advance information (hand and/or button), such that rt shortened with increasing amount of information. we applied 1200 to 2400 pulses of 1-hz rtms over various cortical areas and compared the subjects' performances at various times before and after this intervention. rtms delayed rt at two distinct phases after stimulation, one within 10 min and another with a peak at 20 to 30 min and lasting for 60 to 90 min, with no significant effects on error rates or movement time. the effect was significantly larger on left- than on right-hand responses. rt was prominently delayed over the premotor and motor cortices with similar effects across different conditions of advance information, suggesting that preparatory processes relatively close to the formation of motor output were influenced by rtms. in contrast, the effect of rtms over the supplementary motor area and the anterior parietal cortex varied with the amount of advance information, indicating specific roles played by these areas in integrating target and effector information. the primary motor area, especially of the left hemisphere, may take over this processing, implementing motor output based on the information processed in other areas.' of a research paper.

7013,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Heterogeneous Social Linked Data Integration and Sharing for Public Transportation and abstract: solid (social linked data) technology has made significant progress in social web applications developed, such as facebook, twitter, and wikipedia. solid is based on semantic web and rdf (resource description framework) technologies. solid platforms can provide decentralized authentication, data management, and developer support in the form of libraries and web applications. however, thus far, little research has been conducted on understanding the problems involved in sharing public transportation data through solid technology. it is challenging to provide personalized and adaptable public transportation services for citizens because the public transportation data originate from different devices and are heterogeneous in nature. a novel approach is proposed in this study, in order to provide personalized sharing of public transportation data between different users through integrating and sharing these heterogeneous data. this approach not only integrates diverse data types into a uniform data type using the semantic web but also stores these data in a personal online data store and retrieves data through sparql on the solid platform; these data are visualized on the web pages using google maps. to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply solid in public transportation. furthermore, we conduct performance tests of the new c2rmf (csv to rdf mapping file) algorithm and functional and non-functional tests to demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the approach. our results indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach in facilitating public transportation data integration and sharing through solid and semantic web technologies.' of a research paper.

2045,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: bioNerDS: exploring bioinformatics’ database and software use through literature mining and abstract: abstract background biology-focused databases and software define bioinformatics and their use is central to computational biology. in such a complex and dynamic field, it is of interest to understand what resources are available, which are used, how much they are used, and for what they are used. while scholarly literature surveys can provide some insights, large-scale computer-based approaches to identify mentions of bioinformatics databases and software from primary literature would automate systematic cataloguing, facilitate the monitoring of usage, and provide the foundations for the recovery of computational methods for analysing biological data, with the long-term aim of identifying best/common practice in different areas of biology. results we have developed bionerds, a named entity recogniser for the recovery of bioinformatics databases and software from primary literature. we identify such entities with an f-measure ranging from 63% to 91% at the mention level and 63-78% at the document level, depending on corpus. not attaining a higher f-measure is mostly due to high ambiguity in resource naming, which is compounded by the on-going introduction of new resources. to demonstrate the software, we applied bionerds to full-text articles from bmc bioinformatics and genome biology. general mention patterns reflect the remit of these journals, highlighting bmc bioinformatics’s emphasis on new tools and genome biology’s greater emphasis on data analysis. the data also illustrates some shifts in resource usage: for example, the past decade has seen r and the gene ontology join blast and genbank as the main components in bioinformatics processing. conclusions we demonstrate the feasibility of automatically identifying resource names on a large-scale from the scientific literature and show that the generated data can be used for exploration of bioinformatics database and software usage. for example, our results help to investigate the rate of change in resource usage and corroborate the suspicion that a vast majority of resources are created, but rarely (if ever) used thereafter. bionerds is available at http://bionerds.sourceforge.net/.' of a research paper.

8402,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Nationwide assessment of the mental health of UK Doctoral Researchers and abstract: doctoral researchers (drs) are an important part of the academic community and, after graduating, make substantial social and economic contributions. despite this importance, dr wellbeing has long been of concern. recent studies have concluded that drs may be particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, yet direct comparisons of the prevalence of mental health problems between this population and control groups are lacking. here, by comparing drs with educated working controls, we show that drs report significantly greater anxiety and depression, and that this difference is not explained by a higher rate of pre-existing mental health problems. moreover, most drs perceive poor mental health as a ‘normal’ part of the phd process. thus, our findings suggest a hazardous impact of phd study on mental health, with drs being particularly at risk of developing common mental health problems. this provides an evidence-based mandate for universities and funders to reflect upon practices related to dr training and mental health. our attention should now be directed towards understanding what factors may explain heightened anxiety and depression among drs so as to inform preventative measures and interventions.' of a research paper.

7709,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Clustered repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence: a randomized controlled trial and abstract: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) may have the potential to prevent depressive relapse. this assessor-blinded, randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rtms as a mono- and combination therapy in the prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence. a total of 281 depressed patients who had achieved stable full or partial remission on a 6-month antidepressant (adp) run-in treatment were randomly assigned to an rtms (n = 91), adp (n = 108), or combined (rtms + adp, n = 82) treatment group for 12 months. monthly clustered rtms was conducted in 5–10 sessions over a 3–5-day period. maintenance outcomes were assessed using time to relapse/recurrence and relapse/recurrence rate. overall, 71.2% (200/281) of the participants completed the treatment per the protocol. rtms + adp and rtms significantly reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence compared with adp (p = 0.000), with hazard ratios of 0.297 and 0.466, respectively. both rtms-containing regimens produced significantly lower relapse/recurrence rates than adp (15.9% and 24.2% vs. 44.4%, p &lt; 0.001). in the relapsed/recurrent subgroup, first-episode depressed, rtms-treated patients had a markedly lower relapse/recurrence rate than adp-treated patients. five patients on the adp-containing regimens, but none on rtms alone, developed acute mania. the rtms-containing regimens had considerably more certain side effects than did the adp group. we concluded that tms, whether as a mono- or additional therapy, is superior to antidepressants in preventing depressive relapse/recurrence, particularly in first-episode depressed patients. the treatment does not increase the risk of manic switch, but may increase the risk of certain side effects.' of a research paper.

3699,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Improving Medical X-ray Report Generation by Using Knowledge Graph and abstract: in clinical diagnosis, radiological reports are essential to guide the patient’s treatment. however, writing radiology reports is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists. existing deep learning methods often ignore the interplay between medical findings, which may be a bottleneck limiting the quality of generated radiology reports. our paper focuses on the automatic generation of medical reports from input chest x-ray images. in this work, we mine the associations between medical discoveries in the given texts and construct a knowledge graph based on the associations between medical discoveries. the patient’s chest x-ray image and clinical history file were used as input to extract the image–text hybrid features. then, this feature is used as the input of the adjacency matrix of the knowledge graph, and the graph neural network is used to aggregate and transfer the information between each node to generate the situational representation of the disease with prior knowledge. these disease situational representations with prior knowledge are fed into the generator for self-supervised learning to generate radiology reports. we evaluate the performance of the proposed method using metrics from natural language generation and clinical efficacy on two public datasets. our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the help of a knowledge graph constituted by prior knowledge of the patient.' of a research paper.

9154,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Modulation of motor cortex neuronal networks by rTMS: comparison of local and remote effects of six different protocols of stimulation and abstract: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) of human motor cortex can produce long-lasting changes in the excitability of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. the effects of rtms depend critically on stimulus frequency. the aim of our present study was to compare the effects of different rtms protocols. we compared the aftereffects of 6 different rtms protocols [paired associative stimulation at interstimulus intervals of 25 (pas25) and 10 ms (pas10); theta burst stimulation delivered as continuous (ctbs) or intermittent delivery pattern (itbs); 1- and 5-hz rtms] on the excitability of stimulated and contralateral motor cortex in 10 healthy subjects. a pronounced increase of cortical excitability, evaluated by measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (meps), was produced by itbs (+56%) and pas25 (+45%). five-hertz rtms did not produce a significant increase of meps. a pronounced decrease of cortical excitability was produced by pas10 (−31%), ctbs (−29%), and 1-hz rtms (−20%). short-interval intracortical inhibition was suppressed by pas10. cortical silent period duration was increased by 1-hz stimulation. no significant effect was observed in the contralateral hemisphere. head-to-head comparison of the different protocols enabled us to identify the most effective paradigms for modulating the excitatory and inhibitory circuits activated by tms.' of a research paper.

271,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Transcranial magnetic stimulation over contralateral primary somatosensory cortex disrupts perception of itch intensity and abstract: itch, a complex unpleasant sensation causing the desire to scratch, results from the activity of a network of brain regions. however, the specific functional contributions of individual regions within this network remain poorly understood. we investigated whether contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (s1, s2) and ipsilateral inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) are critically involved in the cortical processing of acute itch. continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (ctbs) was applied to either s1, s2 or ifg, followed by itch induction using a histamine prick. results indicate a significant reduction in itch intensity when ctbs was applied to s1. stimulation of s2 or the ifg was not associated with a significant reduction in itch intensity. the novel finding of an antipruritic effect elicited by disruption of activity in contralateral s1 suggests a causal role of s1 in encoding the sensory‐discriminative aspect of itch and might be important in future studies on brain interventions for the treatment of itch.' of a research paper.

8120,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Automatic recognition of conceptualization zones in scientific articles and two life science applications and abstract: abstract motivation: scholarly biomedical publications report on the findings of a research investigation. scientists use a well-established discourse structure to relate their work to the state of the art, express their own motivation and hypotheses and report on their methods, results and conclusions. in previous work, we have proposed ways to explicitly annotate the structure of scientific investigations in scholarly publications. here we present the means to facilitate automatic access to the scientific discourse of articles by automating the recognition of 11 categories at the sentence level, which we call core scientific concepts (corescs). these include: hypothesis, motivation, goal, object, background, method, experiment, model, observation, result and conclusion. corescs provide the structure and context to all statements and relations within an article and their automatic recognition can greatly facilitate biomedical information extraction by characterizing the different types of facts, hypotheses and evidence available in a scientific publication. results: we have trained and compared machine learning classifiers (support vector machines and conditional random fields) on a corpus of 265 full articles in biochemistry and chemistry to automatically recognize corescs. we have evaluated our automatic classifications against a manually annotated gold standard, and have achieved promising accuracies with ‘experiment’, ‘background’ and ‘model’ being the categories with the highest f1-scores (76%, 62% and 53%, respectively). we have analysed the task of coresc annotation both from a sentence classification as well as sequence labelling perspective and we present a detailed feature evaluation. the most discriminative features are local sentence features such as unigrams, bigrams and grammatical dependencies while features encoding the document structure, such as section headings, also play an important role for some of the categories. we discuss the usefulness of automatically generated corescs in two biomedical applications as well as work in progress. availability: a web-based tool for the automatic annotation of articles with corescs and corresponding documentation is available online at http://www.sapientaproject.com/softwarehttp://www.sapientaproject.com also contains detailed information pertaining to coresc annotation and links to annotation guidelines as well as a corpus of manually annotated articles, which served as our training data. contact: liakata@ebi.ac.uk supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.' of a research paper.

5146,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: The effect of stimulation interval on plasticity following repeated blocks of intermittent theta burst stimulation and abstract: this study assessed the effect of interval duration on the direction and magnitude of changes in cortical excitability and inhibition when applying repeated blocks of intermittent theta burst stimulation (itbs) over motor cortex. 15 participants received three different itbs conditions on separate days: single itbs; repeated itbs with a 5 minute interval (itbs-5-itbs); and with a 15 minute interval (itbs-15-itbs). changes in cortical excitability and short-interval cortical inhibition (sici) were assessed via motor-evoked potentials (meps) before and up to 60 mins following stimulation. itbs-15-itbs increased mep amplitude for up to 60 mins post stimulation, whereas itbs-5-itbs decreased mep amplitude. in contrast, mep amplitude was not altered by single itbs. despite the group level findings, only 53% of individuals showed facilitated meps following itbs-15-itbs, and only 40% inhibited meps following itbs-5-itbs. modulation of sici did not differ between conditions. these results suggest interval duration between spaced itbs plays an important role in determining the direction of plasticity on excitatory, but not inhibitory circuits in human motor cortex. while repeated itbs can increase the magnitude of mep facilitation/inhibition in some individuals compared to single itbs, the response to repeated itbs appears variable between individuals in this small sample.' of a research paper.

1476,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: A Single Dose of Self-Transcribing and Replicating RNA Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Produces Protective Adaptive Immunity In Mice and abstract: abstracta self-transcribing and replicating rna (starr™) based vaccine (lunar®-cov19) has been developed to prevent sars-cov-2 infection. the vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based replicon and the sars-cov-2 full length spike glycoprotein. translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein expression. a single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific cd8+ t lymphocyte response. assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for ifn-γ and il-4 positive cd4+ t helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein igg2a/igg1 ratios supported a strong th1 dominant immune response. finally, single lunar-cov19 vaccination at both 2 μg and 10 μg doses completely protected human ace2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type sars-cov-2 challenge. our findings collectively suggest the potential of lunar-cov19 as a single dose vaccine.' of a research paper.

7033,Please answer the following question.,"Research field prediction: This is the title: Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown in a European Regional Monitoring Network (Spain): Are We Free from Pollution Episodes? and abstract: the impact of the lockdown, during the period from march to june in 2020, upon the air quality of the basque country in northern spain is analyzed. the evaluation accounts for the meteorology of the period. daily and sub-daily analysis of aerosol and ozone records show that the territory was repeatedly affected by episodes of pollutants from outer regions. three episodes of pm10 and ten of pm2.5 were caused by transported anthropogenic european sulfates, african dust, and wildland fires. the region, with a varied orographic climatology, shows high and diverse industrial activity. urban and interurban road traffic of the region decreased by 49% and 53%, respectively, whereas industrial activity showed a lower reduction of 20%. consequently, the average concentrations of no2 in the cities during the period fell to 12.4 µg·m−3 (−45%). ozone showed up to five exceedances of the whoaqg for the daily maximum 8-h average in both rural and urban sites, associated with transport through france and the bay of biscay, under periods of european blocking anticyclones. however, averages showed a moderate decrease (−11%) in rural environments, in line with the precursor reductions, and disparate changes in the cities, which reproduced the weekend effect of their historical records. the pm10 decreased less than expected (−10% and −21%, in the urban and rural environments, respectively), probably caused by the modest decrease of industrial activity around urban sites and favorable meteorology for secondary aerosol formation, which could also influence the lower changes observed in the pm2.5 (−1% and +3% at the urban and rural sites, respectively). consequently, in a future low nox traffic emission scenario, the inter-regional pm and ozone control will require actions across various sectors, including the industry and common pollution control strategies.' of a research paper.
