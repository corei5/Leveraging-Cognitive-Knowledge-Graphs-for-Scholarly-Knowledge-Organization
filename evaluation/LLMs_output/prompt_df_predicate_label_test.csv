A Cortical Correlate of Linguistic Informativeness and abstract: the production of informative messages is an effortful endeavor that relies on the interaction between microlinguistic (i.e., lexical and grammatical) and macrolinguistic (i.e., pragmatic and discourse) levels of processing. although the neural correlates of microlinguistic processing have been extensively studied, investigation of the ability to organize the macrolinguistic aspects of message production is scanty. in this article, we show that repetitive tms of the dorsal portion of the anterior left, but not right, inferior frontal gyrus reduces the levels of lexical informativeness and global coherence of narratives produced by healthy individuals. interestingly, levels of productivity and microlinguistic processing were unaffected by the stimulation. these results suggest that the dorsal aspect of the anterior left inferior frontal gyrus is an epicenter of a wider neural network subserving the selection of contextually appropriate semantic representations.' of a research paper.

(1) the rf classification algorithm supported by the gee platform enables fast and accurate acquisition of the lulc dataset, and the overall accuracy is 0.88 ± 0.01. (2) the ecological condition across xilingol has improved significantly in the last 20 years (2000–2020), and the area of vegetation (grassland and woodland) has increased. specifically, the area of high-coverage grass and woodland increases (+13.26%, +1.19%), while the area of water and moderate- and low-coverage grass decreases (−15.96%, −7.23%, and −3.27%). cropland increases first and then decreases (−34.85%) and is mainly distributed in the southeast. the area of deserted land decreases in the south and increases in the center and north, but the total area still decreases (−13.74%). the built-up land expands rapidly (+108.45%). (3) in addition, our results suggest that regional socioeconomic development factors are the primary causes of changes in built-up land, and climate-related factors are the primary causes of water changes, but the correlations between other land-use types and relevant factors are not significant (cropland and grassland). we conclude that the gee+rf method is capable of automated, long time-series, and high-accuracy land-use mapping, and further changes in climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic development factors, i.e., climate warming and rotational grazing, might have significant implications on regional land surface morphology and landscape dynamics.' of a research paper.

Effects of Fe xxiv Resonant Auger Destruction on Fe xxv Kα Spectra and abstract: abstract we discuss the importance of fe23+ in determining the line intensities of the fe xxv kα complex in an optically thick cloud, and investigate resonant auger destruction (rad) with cloudy. although initially motivated by the perseus cluster, our calculations are extended to the wide range of column densities encountered in astronomy. a fe xxv line photon can change/lose its identity upon absorption by three-electron iron as a result of “line interlocking.” this may lead to the autoionization of the absorbing ion, ultimately destroying the fe xxv kα photon by rad. out of the four members in the fe xxv kα complex, a significant fraction of the x line photons are absorbed by fe23+ and destroyed, causing the x line intensity to decrease. for example, at a hydrogen column density of 1025 cm−2, ∼32% of x photons are destroyed due to rad while w is mostly unaffected. the line intensity of y is slightly (≤2%) reduced. z is not directly affected by rad, but the contrasting behavior between z and x line intensities points toward the possible conversion of a tiny fraction (∼2%) of x photons into z photons. the change in line intensities due to electron scattering escape off fast thermal electrons is also discussed.' of a research paper.
