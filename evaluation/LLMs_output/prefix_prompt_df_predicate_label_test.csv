A Cortical Correlate of Linguistic Informativeness and abstract: the production of informative messages is an effortful endeavor that relies on the interaction between microlinguistic (i.e., lexical and grammatical) and macrolinguistic (i.e., pragmatic and discourse) levels of processing. although the neural correlates of microlinguistic processing have been extensively studied, investigation of the ability to organize the macrolinguistic aspects of message production is scanty. in this article, we show that repetitive tms of the dorsal portion of the anterior left, but not right, inferior frontal gyrus reduces the levels of lexical informativeness and global coherence of narratives produced by healthy individuals. interestingly, levels of productivity and microlinguistic processing were unaffected by the stimulation. these results suggest that the dorsal aspect of the anterior left inferior frontal gyrus is an epicenter of a wider neural network subserving the selection of contextually appropriate semantic representations.' of a research paper.

(1) the rf classification algorithm supported by the gee platform enables fast and accurate acquisition of the lulc dataset, and the overall accuracy is 0.88 ± 0.01. (2) the ecological condition across xilingol has improved significantly in the last 20 years (2000–2020), and the area of vegetation (grassland and woodland) has increased. specifically, the area of high-coverage grass and woodland increases (+13.26%, +1.19%), while the area of water and moderate- and low-coverage grass decreases (−15.96%, −7.23%, and −3.27%). cropland increases first and then decreases (−34.85%) and is mainly distributed in the southeast. the area of deserted land decreases in the south and increases in the center and north, but the total area still decreases (−13.74%). the built-up land expands rapidly (+108.45%).

""finding mentions"" is a basic task, which can be used as a building block for other text mining tasks. the task makes use of data and evaluation software provided by the (us) national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). results 15 teams took part in task 1a. a number of teams achieved scores over 80% f-measure (balanced precision and recall). the teams that tried to use their task 1a systems to help on other biocreative tasks reported mixed results. conclusion the 80% plus f-measure results are good, but still somewhat lag the best scores achieved in some other domains such as newswire, due in part to the complexity and length of gene names, compared to person or organization names in newswire.' of a research paper.

Effects of Fe xxiv Resonant Auger Destruction on Fe xxv Kα Spectra and abstract: abstract we discuss the importance of fe23+ in determining the line intensities of the fe xxv kα complex in an optically thick cloud, and investigate resonant auger destruction (rad) with cloudy. although initially motivated by the perseus cluster, our calculations are extended to the wide range of column densities encountered in astronomy. a fe xxv line photon can change/lose its identity upon absorption by three-electron iron as a result of “line interlocking.” this may lead to the autoionization of the absorbing ion, ultimately destroying the fe xxv kα photon by rad. out of the four members in the fe xxv kα complex, a significant fraction of the x line photons are absorbed by fe23+ and destroyed, causing the x line intensity to decrease. for example, at a hydrogen column density of 1025 cm−2, ∼32% of x photons are destroyed due to rad while w is mostly unaffected. the line intensity of y is slightly (≤2%) reduced. z is not directly affected by rad, but the contrasting behavior between z and x line intensities points toward the possible conversion of a tiny fraction (∼2%) of x photons into z photons. the change in line intensities due to electron scattering escape off fast thermal electrons is also discussed.' of a research paper.

Experimental Evidence from COVID-19 Lockdown and abstract: the increasing concentration of human activities in cities has been leading to a worsening in air quality, thus negatively affecting the lives and health of humans living in urban contexts. transport is one of the main sources of pollution in such environments. several local authorities have therefore implemented strict traffic-restriction measures. the aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of these interventions, by analyzing the relationship between traffic flows and air quality. the used dataset contains concentrations of no, no2, nox and pm10, vehicle counts and meteorology, all collected during the covid-19 lockdown in the city of padova (italy), in which severe limitations to contain the spread of the virus simulated long and large-scale traffic restrictions in normal conditions. in particular, statistical tests, correlation analyses and multivariate linear regression models were applied to non-rainy days in 2020, 2018 and 2017, in order to isolate the effect of traffic. analysis indicated that vehicle flows significantly affect no, no2, and nox concentrations, although no evidence of a relationship between traffic and pm10 was highlighted. according to this perspective, measures to limit traffic flows seem to be effective in improving air quality only in terms of reducing nitrogen oxide.' of a research paper.

842,Please answer the following question.,"List of predicates prediction: This is the title: A synergistic chlorhexidine/chitosan combination for improved antiplaque strategies and abstract: background: the minor efficacy of chlorhexidine (chx) on other cariogenic bacteria than mutans streptococci such as streptococcus sanguinis may contribute to uneffective antiplaque strategies.methods and results: in addition to chx (0.1%) as positive control and saline as negative control, two chitosan derivatives (0.2%) and their chx combinations were applied to planktonic and attached sanguinis streptococci for 2 min. in a preclinical biofilm model, the bacteria suspended in human sterile saliva were allowed to attach to human enamel slides for 60 min under flow conditions mimicking human salivation. the efficacy of the test agents on streptococci was screened by the following parameters: vitality status, colony‐forming units (cfu)/ml and cell density on enamel. the first combination reduced the bacterial vitality to ∼0% and yielded a strong cfu reduction of 2–3 log10 units, much stronger than chx alone. furthermore, the first chitosan derivative showed a significant decrease of the surface coverage with these treated streptococci after attachment to enamel.conclusions: based on these results, a new chx formulation would be beneficial unifying the bioadhesive properties of chitosan with the antibacterial activity of chx synergistically resulting in a superior antiplaque effect than chx alone.' of a research paper.
